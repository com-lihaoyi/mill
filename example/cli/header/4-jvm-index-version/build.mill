// Mill uses the https://github.com/coursier/jvm-index[Coursier JVM Index] to resolve JVM
// versions to their download location, as well as partially-qualified versions such as
// `temurin:11` to the specific point version such as `temurin:11.0.28`. The version of
// the JVM index is set by the version of Mill you are using, but you can override it
// to use a newer JVM index (e.g. if you want to use a newly-released JVM not yet included
// in Mill's jvm index version) or an older JVM index.
//
// The list of JVM index versions can be seen here:
//
// - https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/get-coursier/jvm/indices/[JVM Indices on Maven Central]

def printJavaVersion() = Task.Command {
  println("Java version: " + System.getProperty("java.version"))
}

// This example uses an older `mill-jvm-index-version` to ensure the resolved version
// of `temurin:17` gets appropriately downgraded from `17.0.17` (the most recent `17.x` version)
// to `17.0.14` (the version of `17.x` available when the JVM index `0.0.4-88-f9ba3d` was released)
/** Usage

> ./mill printJavaVersion
Java version: 17.0.14
