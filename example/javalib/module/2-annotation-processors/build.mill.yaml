# This is an example of how to use Mill to build Java projects using Java
# annotations and annotation processors. In this case, we use the annotations
# provided by Project Lombok to automatically generate getters and setters
# from class private fields.
#
# The Java compiler automatically discovers annotation processors based on the
# classes available during compilation, e.g. in `compileMvnDeps` or `mvnDeps`,
# which is what takes place in the `foo` module below.
#
# However, in future versions of Javac, annotation processing may be disabled
# without explicitly naming at least one processor or explicitly enabling
# processing.
#
# You may also need annotation processors that are not on the compilation
# classpath, or you need finer control over exactly which annotation processors
# are active.
#
# Mill provides an easy way to add these processors via `annotationProcessorsMvnDeps`,
# which is demonstrated in the `bar` module below.
#
# Many Java frameworks and libraries such as Micronaut or ErrorProne use
# annotation processors, and can be set up in this way.
