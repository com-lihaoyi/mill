// Mill also creates sandbox folders for test suites to run in. Consider the
// following build with two modules `foo` and `bar`, and their test suites
// `foo.test` and `bar.test`:

package build
import mill._, javalib._

trait MyModule extends JavaModule {
  object test extends JavaTests with TestModule.Junit4
}

object foo extends MyModule {
  def moduleDeps = Seq(bar)
}

object bar extends MyModule

// For the sake of the example, both test modules contain tests that exercise the
// logic in their corresponding non-test module, but also do some basic filesystem
// operations at the same time, writing out a `generated.html` file and then reading it:

/** See Also: foo/src/foo/Foo.java */
/** See Also: foo/test/src/foo/FooTests.java */
/** See Also: bar/src/bar/Bar.java */
/** See Also: bar/test/src/bar/BarTests.java */

// Both test suites can be run via

/** Usage
> ./mill __.test
*/

// Without sandboxing, due to the tests running in parallel, there is a race condition:
// it's possible that `FooTests` may write the file, `BarTests` write over it, before
// `FooTests` reads the output from `BarTests`. That would cause non-deterministic
// flaky failures in your test suite that can be very difficult to debug and resolve.
//
// With Mill's test sandboxing, each test runs in a separate folder: the `.dest` folder
// of the respective task and module. For example:
//
// - `foo.test` runs in `out/foo/test/test.dest/`
// - `bar.test` runs in `out/bar/test/test.dest/`
//
// As a result, each test's `generated.html` file is written to its own dedicated
// working directory, without colliding with each other on disk:

/** Usage

> find . | grep generated.html
.../out/foo/test/test.dest/sandbox/generated.html
.../out/bar/test/test.dest/sandbox/generated.html

> cat out/foo/test/test.dest/sandbox/generated.html
<h1>hello</h1>

> cat out/bar/test/test.dest/sandbox/generated.html
<p>world</p>

*/

// As each test suite runs in a different working directory by default, naive usage
// reading and writing to the filesystem does not cause tests to interefere with
// one another, which helps keep tests stable and deterministic even when run in
// parallel
//
// Like Mill's Task sandboxing, Mill's Test sandboxing does not guard against
// intentional misbehavior: tests can still walk the filesystem from the
// sandbox folder via `..` or from the root folder `/` or home folder `~/`.
// Nevertheless, it should add some simple guardrails to prevent many common
// causes of inter-test interference, letting your test suite run in parallel both
// quickly and reliably
