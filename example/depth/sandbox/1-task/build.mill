// In order to help manage your build, Mill performs some rudimentary filesystem
// sandboxing to keep different tasks and modules from interfering with each other.
// This tries to ensure your tasks only read and write from their designated `.dest/`
// folders, which are unique to each task and thus guaranteed not to collide with
// the filesystem operations of other tasks that may be occurring in parallel.
//
//
// === `Task.dest`
// The standard way of working with a task's `.dest/` folder is through the `Task.dest`
// property. This is available within any task, and gives you access to the
// `out/<module-names>/<task-name>.dest/` folder to use. The `.dest/` folder for
// each task is lazily initialized when `Task.dest` is referenced and used:

package build
import mill._

object foo extends Module{
  def tDestTask = Task { println(Task.dest.toString) }
}

/** Usage
> ./mill foo.tDestTask
.../out/foo/tDestTask.dest
*/


// === Task `os.pwd` redirection
// Mill also redirects the `os.pwd` property from https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/os-lib[OS-Lib],
// such that that also points towards a running task's own `.dest/` folder

def osPwdTask = Task { println(os.pwd.toString) }

/** Usage
> ./mill osPwdTask
.../out/osPwdTask.dest
*/

// The redirection of `os.pwd` applies to `os.proc`, `os.call`, and `os.spawn` methods
// as well. In the example below, we can see the `python3` subprocess we spawn prints
// its `os.getcwd()`, which is our `osProcTask.dest/` sandbox folder:

def osProcTask = Task {
  println(os.call(("python3", "-c", "import os; print(os.getcwd())"), cwd = Task.dest).out.trim())
}

/** Usage
> ./mill osProcTask
.../out/osProcTask.dest
*/

// === Non-task `os.pwd` redirection
//
// Lastly, there is the possibily of calling `os.pwd` outside of a task. When outside of
// a task there is no `.dest/` folder associated, so instead Mill will redirect `os.pwd`
// towards an empty `sandbox/` folder in `out/mill-server/...`:

val externalPwd = os.pwd
def externalPwdTask = Task { println(externalPwd.toString) }

/** Usage
> ./mill externalPwdTask
.../out/mill-server/.../sandbox
*/


// === Limitations of Mill's Sandboxing
//
// Mill's approach to filesystem sandboxing is designed to avoid accidental interference
// between different Mill tasks. It is not designed to block intentional misbehavior, and
// tasks are always able to traverse the filesystem and do whatever they want. Furthermore,
// Mill's redirection of `os.pwd` does not apply to `java.io` or `java.nio` APIs, which are
// outside of Mill's control.
//
// However, by setting `os.pwd` to safe sandbox folders, we hope to minimize the cases where
// someone accidentally causes issues with their build by doing the wrong thing.
