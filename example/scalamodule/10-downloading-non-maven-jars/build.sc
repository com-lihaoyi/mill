// You can also override `unmanagedClasspath` to point it at jars that you want to
// download from arbitrary URLs. Note that targets like `unmanagedClasspath` are
// cached, so your jar is downloaded only once and re-used indefinitely after that.
// `requests.get` comes from the https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/requests-scala[Requests-Scala]
// library, which is bundled with Mill

/** Usage

> ./mill run "textfile.txt" # mac/linux
