// Mill makes it very easy to customize your build graph, overriding portions
// of it with custom logic. In this example, we override the JVM `resources` of
// our `{language}Module` - normally the `resources/` folder - to instead contain a
// single generated text file containing the line count of all the source files
// in that module

// Above, `def lineCount` is a new build task we define, which makes use of
// `allSourceFiles` (an existing task) and is in-turn used in our override of
// `resources` (also an existing task). `os.read.lines` and `os.write` come
// from the https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/os-lib[OS-Lib] library, which is
// one of Mill's <<Bundled Libraries>>. This generated file can then be
// loaded and used at runtime, as see in the output of `mill run`
//
// While this is a toy example, it shows how easy it is to customize your Mill
// build to include the kinds of custom logic common in the build config of
// most real-world projects.
//
// This customization is done in a principled fashion familiar to most
// programmers - object-orienting overrides - rather than ad-hoc
// monkey-patching or mutation common in other build tools. You never have
// "spooky action at a distance" affecting your build / graph definition, and
// your IDE can always help you find the final override of any particular build
// task as well as where any overriden implementations may be defined.
//
// Unlike normal methods, custom user-defined tasks in Mill benefit from all
// the same things that built-in tasks do: automatic caching (in the
// xref:depth/out-dir.adoc[`out/` folder]), parallelism (with the `-j`/`--jobs`
// flag), inspectability (via `show`/`inspect`), and so on.
// While these things may not matter for such a simple example that runs
// quickly, they ensure that custom build logic remains performant and
// maintainable even as the complexity of your project grows.
