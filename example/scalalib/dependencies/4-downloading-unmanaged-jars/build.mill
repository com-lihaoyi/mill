// You can also override `unmanagedClasspath` to point it at jars that you want to
// download from arbitrary URLs.
// `requests.get` comes from the https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/requests-scala[Requests-Scala]
// library, one of Mill's xref:fundamentals/bundled-libraries.adoc[Bundled Libraries].
//

/** Usage

> ./mill run "textfile.txt" # mac/linux
I am cow
hear me moo
I weigh twice as much as you

*/

// Note that tasks like `unmanagedClasspath` are
// cached, so your jar is downloaded only once and re-used indefinitely after that.
// This is usually not a problem, because usually URLs follow the rule that
// https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI[Cool URIs don't change], and so jars
// downloaded from the same URL will always contain the same contents.
