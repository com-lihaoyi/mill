// Tasks like `unmanagedClasspath` are
// cached, so your jar is downloaded only once and re-used indefinitely after that.
// This is usually not a problem, because usually URLs follow the rule that
// https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI[Cool URIs don't change], and so jars
// downloaded from the same URL will always contain the same contents.

/** Usage

> ./mill --offline run "textfile.txt"

//
// NOTE: An unmanaged jar downloaded via `requests.get` is still unmanaged: even
// though you downloaded it from somewhere, it `requests.get` does not know how to
// pull in transitive dependencies or de-duplicate different versions on the classpath
// All the same caveats you need to worry about when dealing with xref:#_unmanaged_jars[unmanaged jars]
// apply here as well.
