// Test Grouping is an opt-in feature that allows you to take a single
// test module and group the test classes such that each group will
// execute in parallel in a separate JVM when you call `test`. Test grouping
// is enabled by overriding `def testForkGrouping`, as shown below:

//// SNIPPET:BUILD1
package build
import mill._, scalalib._

object foo extends ScalaModule {
  def scalaVersion = "2.13.8"
  object test extends ScalaTests {
    def ivyDeps = Agg(mvn"com.lihaoyi::utest:0.8.5")
    def testFramework = "utest.runner.Framework"
    def testForkGrouping = discoveredTestClasses().grouped(1).toSeq
  }
}

/** See Also: foo/test/src/HelloTests.scala */
/** See Also: foo/test/src/WorldTests.scala */

//// SNIPPET:END

// In this example, we have one test module `foo.test`, and two test classes
// `HelloTests` and `WorldTests`. By default, all test classes in the same
// module run sequentially in the same JVM, but with `testForkGrouping` we can break up the
// module and run each test class in parallel in separate JVMs, each with their own
// separate `sandbox` folder and `.log` file:

/** Usage

> mill foo.test

> find out/foo/test/test.dest
...
out/foo/test/test.dest/foo.HelloTests.log
out/foo/test/test.dest/foo.HelloTests/sandbox
out/foo/test/test.dest/foo.WorldTests.log
out/foo/test/test.dest/foo.WorldTests/sandbox
out/foo/test/test.dest/test-report.xml

// Compared to xref:#_test_parallelism[], test grouping allows you to run tests in parallel
// while and isolating different test groups into their own subprocesses, at the cost of
// greater subprocess overhead due to the larger number of isolated subprocesses.
// Different test groups will not write over each others files in their
// sandbox, and each one will have a separate set of logs that can be easily read
// without the others mixed in
//
// In this example, `def testForkGrouping = discoveredTestClasses().grouped(1).toSeq` assigns
// each test class to its own group, running in its own JVM. You can also configure
// `testForkGrouping` to choose which test classes you want to run together and which to
// run alone:
//
// * If some test classes
//   are much slower than others, you may want to put the slow test classes each in its own
//   group to reduce latency, while grouping multiple fast test classes together to reduce the
//   per-group overhead of spinning up a separate JVM.
//
// * Some test classes may have global JVM-wide or filesystem side effects that means they
//   have to run alone, while other test classes may be better-behaved and OK to run in a group
//
// In general, `testForkGrouping` leaves it up to you how you want to group your tests for
// execution, based on the unique constraints of your test suite.
