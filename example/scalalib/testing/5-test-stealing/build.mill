// Test stealing is an opt-in, powerful feature that enables parallel test execution.
// When enabled, Mill automatically distributes your test classes across multiple JVM subprocesses.
// This is especially useful when you have multiple test classes that can be run in parallel.
// Work stealing scheduler ensures throughput is maximized: no "slow" tests can block "fast" tests.
// This feature is expected to be enabled by default in future versions of Mill.
//
// Test stealing can be enabled by overriding def testEnableWorkStealing, as demonstrated below.
