# When using Scala 3 you're also able to use Scaladoc to generate a full static
# site next to your API documentation. This can include general documentation for
# your project and even a blog.
#
# By default, Mill will consider the _site root_ as it's called in Scala 3
# docs, to be the value of `docResources()`. It will look there for your
# `_docs/` and your `_blog/` directory if any exist.
