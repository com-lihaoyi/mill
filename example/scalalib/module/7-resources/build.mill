// This section discusses how tests can depend on resources locally on disk.
// Mill provides two ways to do this: via the JVM classpath resources, and via
// the resource folder which is made available as the environment variable
// `MILL_TEST_RESOURCE_DIR` available in test suites:
//
// * The *classpath resources* are useful when you want to fetch individual files,
//   and are bundled with the application by the `.assembly` step when constructing
//   an assembly jar for deployment. But they do not allow you to list folders
//   or perform other filesystem operations.
//
// * The *resource folder*, available via `MILL_TEST_RESOURCE_DIR`, gives you
//   access to the folder path of the resources on disk. This is useful in allowing
//   you to list and otherwise manipulate the filesystem, which you cannot do with
//   *classpath resources*. However, the `MILL_TEST_RESOURCE_DIR` _only_ exists
//   when running tests using Mill, and is _not_ available when executing applications
//   packaged for deployment via `.assembly`
//
// * Apart from `resources/`, you can provide additional folders to your test suite
//   by defining a `Task.Source` (`otherFiles` above) and passing it to `forkEnv`. This
//   provide the folder path as an environment variable that the test can make use of
//
// Example application code demonstrating the techniques above can be seen below:

/** See Also: foo/resources/file.txt */
/** See Also: foo/test/resources/test-file-a.txt */
/** See Also: foo/test/resources/test-file-b.txt */
/** See Also: foo/test/other-files/other-file.txt */

//
//
// Tests by default only have access to their *classpath resources* and
// *resource folder* as mentioned above. They cannot read random project files on disk,
// and require that you pass in any other
// files or folders that they require explicitly (e.g. `def otherFiles` above).
// This is necessary so that Mill can ensure the necessary files are in place
// before the test begins running, and so `-w`/`--watch` knows it needs to re-run
// the tests if those files changed. Thus your tests cannot just read project files
// direct off disk via `new FileInputStream("foo/resources/test-file-a.txt")`.
//
// Mill runs test processes in a xref:depth/sandboxing.adoc[sandbox/ folder], rather
// than in your project root folder, to enforce this.
// If you have legacy tests that need to run in the project root folder to work, you
// can configure your test suite with `def testSandboxWorkingDir = false` to disable
// the sandbox and make the tests run in the project root.
