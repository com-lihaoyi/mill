# You can use Scala compiler plugins by setting `scalacPluginMvnDeps`. The below
# example also adds the plugin to `compileMvnDeps`, since that plugin's artifact
# is needed on the compilation classpath (though not at runtime).
#
# NOTE: Remember that compiler plugins are published against the full Scala
# version (eg. 2.13.16 instead of just 2.13), so when including them make sure to
# use the `:::` syntax shown below in the example.
