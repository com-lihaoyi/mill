/**
 * Manage the setup, teardown, and caching of objects of type [[V]] safely
 * in a multithreaded environment.
 *
 * The user provides the [[setup]] and [[teardown]] logic along with  a [[maxCacheSize]],
 * and [[CachedFactory]] provides instances of [[V]] as requested using the [[withValue]]
 * method. These instances are automatically constructed on-demand from the give key,
 * cached with an LRU strategy, and destroyed when they are eventually evicted
 *
 * Intended for relatively small caches approximately O(num-threads) in size that
 * will typically get used in a build system, not intended for caching large amounts of entries
