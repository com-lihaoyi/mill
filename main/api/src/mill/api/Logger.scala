/**
 * The standard logging interface of the Mill build tool.
 *
 * Contains these primary logging methods, in order of increasing importance:
 *
 * - `debug` : internal debug messages normally not shown to the user;
 * mostly useful when debugging issues
 *
 * - `ticker`: short-lived logging output where consecutive lines over-write
 * each other; useful for information which is transient and disposable
 *
 * - `info`: miscellaneous logging output which isn't part of the main output
 * a user is looking for, but useful to provide context on what Mill is doing
 *
 * - `error`: logging output which represents problems the user should care
 * about
 *
 * Also contains the two forwarded stdout and stderr streams, for code executed
 * by Mill to use directly. Typically these correspond to the stdout and stderr,
 * but when `show` is used both are forwarded to stderr and stdout is only
 * used to display the final `show` output for easy piping.
