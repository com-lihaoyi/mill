/**
 * The locks used to manage the relationship of Mill between Mill's clients and servers.
 * The protocol is as follows:
 *
 * - Client:
 *   - Take clientLock
 *   - If processLock is not yet taken, it means server is not running, so spawn a server
 *   - Wait for server socket to be available for connection
 * - Server:
 *   - Take processLock.
 *     - If already taken, it means another server was running
 *       (e.g. spawned by a different client) so exit immediately
 * - Server: loop:
 *   - Listen for incoming client requests on serverSocket
 *   - Execute client request
 *   - If clientLock is released during execution, terminate server (otherwise
 *     we have no safe way of termianting the in-process request, so the server
 *     may continue running for arbitrarily long with no client attached)
 *   - Send `ProxyStream.END` packet and call `clientSocket.close()`
 * - Client:
 *   - Wait for `ProxyStream.END` packet or `clientSocket.close()`,
 *     indicating server has finished execution and all data has been received
