Your shiny new Scala build tool! Confused by SBT? Frustrated by Maven? Perplexed
by Gradle? Give Mill a try!

If you want to use Mill in your own projects, check out our documentation:

- [Documentation](http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/)

Here is some quick example, so that you can imagine how it looks:

```scala
import mill._, scalalib._

object foo extends ScalaModule {
  def scalaVersion = "2.13.1"
}

object bar extends ScalaModule {
  def moduleDeps = Seq(foo)
  def scalaVersion = "2.13.1"
}
```

If you use Mill and like it, you will probably enjoy the following book by the Author:

- [*Hands-on Scala Programming*](https://www.handsonscala.com/)

*Hands-on Scala* has a *Chapter 10: Static Build Pipelines* dedicated to Mill,
but rest of the book introduces other libraries and tools in a similar style.
*Hands-on Scala* is a great way to level up your skills in Scala in general 
and Mill in particular

The remainder of this readme is developer-documentation targeted at people who
wish to work on Mill's own codebase. The developer docs assume you have read
through the user-facing documentation linked above. It's also worth spending a
few minutes reading the following blog posts to get a sense of Mill's design &
motivation:

- [So, what's wrong with SBT?](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/SowhatswrongwithSBT.html)
- [Build Tools as Pure Functional Programs](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildToolsasPureFunctionalPrograms.html)
- [Mill: Better Scala Builds](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/MillBetterScalaBuilds.html)

## How to build and test

Mill is built using Mill. To begin, first download & install Mill as described
in the documentation above. As Mill is under active development, stable releases
may not be able to build the current development branch of Mill. It is
recommended to install the latest unstable release manually.

### IntelliJ Setup

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA to edit Mill's Scala code, you can create the
IntelliJ project files via:

```bash
./mill mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea
```

### Automated Tests

To run test suites:

```bash
./mill main.test
./mill scalalib.test
./mill scalajslib.test
./mill integration.test
```

### Manual Testing

To manually test Mill on a small build, you can use the `scratch` folder:

```bash
./mill -i dev.run scratch -w resolve _
```

This runs the task `resolve _` with your current checkout of Mill on the trivial build defined in
`scratch/build.sc`. You can modify that build file to add additional modules,
files, etc. and see how it behaves.

More generally, you can use:

```bash
./mill -i dev.run [target-dir] [...args]
```

To create run your current checkout of Mill in the given `target-dir` with the
given `args`. This is useful e.g. to test a modified version of Mill on some
other project's Mill build.

You can also create a launcher-script to let you run the current checkout of
Mill without the bootstrap Mill process present:

```bash
./mill dev.launcher
```

This creates the `out/dev/launcher/dest/run` launcher script, which you can then
use to run your current checkout of Mill where-ever you'd like. Note that this
script relies on the compiled code already present in the Mill `out/` folder,
and thus isn't suitable for testing on Mill's own Mill build since you would be
over-writing the compiled code at the same time as the launcher script is using
it.

You can also run your current checkout of Mill on the build in your `scratch/`
folder without the bootstrap Mill process being present via:

```bash
./mill dev.launcher && (cd scratch && ../out/dev/launcher/dest/run -w show thingy)
```

### Bootstrapping: Building Mill with your current checkout of Mill

To test bootstrapping of Mill's own Mill build using a version of Mill built
from your checkout, you can run

```bash
ci/publish-local.sh
```

This creates a standalone assembly at `~/mill-release` you can use, which
references jars published locally in your `~/.ivy2/local` cache. You can then
use this standalone assembly to build & re-build your current Mill checkout
without worrying about stomping over compiled code that the assembly is using.

This assemby is design to work on bash, bash-like shells and Windows Cmd. 
If you have another default shell like zsh or fish, you probably need to invoke it
with `sh ~/mill-release` or prepend the file with a proper shebang. 

### Troubleshooting

In case of troubles with caching and/or incremental compilation, you can always
restart from scratch removing the `out` directory:

```bash
os.remove.all -rf out/
```

## Project Layout

The Mill project is organized roughly as follows:

### Core modules that are included in the main assembly

- `core`, `main`, `main.client`, `scalalib`, `scalajslib`.

These are general lightweight and dependency-free: mostly configuration & wiring
of a Mill build and without the heavy lifting.

Heavy lifting is delegated to the worker modules (described below), which the
core modules resolve from Maven Central (or from the local filesystem in
dev) and load into isolated classloaders.

### Worker modules that are resolved from Maven Central

- `scalalib.worker`, `scalajslib.worker[0.6]`, `scalajslib.worker[1.0]`

These modules are where the heavy-lifting happens, and include heavy
dependencies like the Scala compiler, Scala.js optimizer, etc.. Rather than
being bundled in the main assembly & classpath, these are resolved separately
from Maven Central (or from the local filesystem in dev) and kept in isolated
classloaders.

This allows a single Mill build to use multiple versions of e.g. the Scala.js
optimizer without classpath conflicts.

### Contrib modules

- `contrib/bloop/`, `contrib/flyway/`, `contrib/scoverage/`, etc.

These are modules that help integrate Mill with the wide variety of different
tools and utilities available in the JVM ecosystem.

These modules are not as stringently reviewed as the main Mill core/worker codebase,
and are primarily maintained by their individual contributors. These are maintained
as part of the primary Mill Github repo for easy testing/updating as the core Mill
APIs evolve, ensuring that they are always tested and passing against the 
corresponding version of Mill.

### 0.1.7
 
- Support for non-interactive (client/server) mode on Windows.

- More fixes for Java 9

- Bumped the Mill daemon timeout from 1 minute to 5 minutes of inactivity before
  it shuts down.

- Avoid leaking Node.js subprocesses when running `ScalaJSModule` tests

- Passing command-line arguments with spaces in them to tests no longer parses
  wrongly

- `ScalaModule#repositories`, `scalacPluginIvyDeps`, `scalacOptions`,
  `javacOptions` are now automatically propagated to `Tests` modules

- `ScalaJSModule` linking errors no longer show a useless stack trace

- `ScalaModule#docJar` now properly uses the compileClasspath rather than
  runClasspath

- Bumped underlying Ammonite version to [1.1.0](http://ammonite.io/#1.1.0),
  which provides the improved Windows and Java 9 support

### 0.1.6

- Fixes for non-interactive (client/server) mode on Java 9

- Windows batch (.bat) generation for launcher, assembly, and release

### 0.1.5

- Introduced the `mill plan foo.bar` command, which shows you what the execution
  plan of running the `foo.bar` task looks like without actually evaluating it.

- Mill now generates an `out/mill-profile.json` file containing task-timings, to
  make it easier to see where your mill evaluation time is going
  
- Introduced `ScalaModule#ivyDepsTree` command to show dependencies tree
  
- Rename `describe` to `inspect` for consistency with SBT

- `mill resolve` now prints results sorted alphabetically

- Node.js configuration can be customised with `ScalaJSModule#nodeJSConfig`

- Scala.js `fullOpt` now uses Google Closure Compiler after generating the optimized Javascript output

- Scala.js now supports `NoModule` and `CommonJSModule` module kinds

- Include `compileIvyDeps` when generating IntelliJ projects

- Fixed invalid POM generation

- Support for Java 9 (and 10)

- Fixes for Windows support

- Fixed test classes discovery by skipping interfaces

- Include "optional" artifacts in dependency resolution if they exist

- `out/{module_name}` now added as a content root in generated IntelliJ project

### 0.1.4

- Speed up Mill client initialization by another 50-100ms

- Speed up incremental `assembly`s in the common case where upstream
  dependencies do not change.

- Make `ScalaJSModule#run` work with main-method discovery

- Make `ScalaWorkerModule` user-defineable, so you can use your own custom
  coursier resolvers when resolving Mill's own jars

- Simplify definitions of `SCM` strings

- Make the build REPL explicitly require `-i`/`--interactive` to run

- Log a message when Mill is initializing the Zinc compiler interface

### 0.1.3

- Greatly reduced the overhead of evaluating Mill tasks, with a warm
  already-cached `mill dev.launcher` now taking ~450ms instead of ~1000ms

- Mill now saves compiled build files in `~/.mill/ammonite`, which is
  configurable via the `--home` CLI arg.

- Fixed linking of multi-module Scala.js projects

### 0.1.2

- Mill now keeps a long-lived work-daemon around in between commands; this
  should improve performance of things like `compile` which benefit from the
  warm JVM. You can use `-i`/`--interactive` for interactive consoles/REPLs and
  for running commands without the daemon

- Implemented the `ScalaModule#launcher` target for easily creating command-line
  launchers you can run outside of Mill

- `ScalaModule#docJar` no longer fails if you don't have `scala-compiler` on
  classpath

- Support for multiple `testFrameworks` in a test module.

### 0.1.1
