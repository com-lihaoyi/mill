Your shiny new Scala build tool! Confused by SBT? Frustrated by Maven? Perplexed
by Gradle? Give Mill a try!

If you want to use Mill in your own projects, check out our documentation:

- [Documentation](http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/)

The remainder of this readme is developer-documentation targeted at people who
wish to work on Mill's own codebase. The developer docs assume you have read
through the user-facing documentation linked above. It's also worth spending a
few minutes reading the following blog posts to get a sense of Mill's design &
motivation:

- [So, what's wrong with SBT?](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/SowhatswrongwithSBT.html)
- [Build Tools as Pure Functional Programs](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildToolsasPureFunctionalPrograms.html)
- [Mill: Better Scala Builds](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/MillBetterScalaBuilds.html)

## How to build and test

Mill is built using Mill. To begin, first download & install Mill as described
in the documentation above. As Mill is under active development, stable releases
may not be able to build the current development branch of Mill. It is
recommended to install the latest unstable release manually.

### IntelliJ Setup

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA to edit Mill's Scala code, you can create the
IntelliJ project files via:

```bash
mill mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea
```

### Automated Tests

To run test suites:

```bash
mill main.test
mill scalalib.test
mill scalajslib.test
mill integration.test
```

### Manual Testing

To manually test Mill on a small build, you can use the `scratch` folder:

```bash
mill -i dev.run scratch -w show thingy
```

This runs your current checkout of Mill on the trivial build defined in
`scratch/build.sc`. You can modify that build file to add additional modules,
files, etc. and see how it behaves.

More generally, you can use:

```bash
mill -i dev.run [target-dir] [...args]
```

To create run your current checkout of Mill in the given `target-dir` with the
given `args`. This is useful e.g. to test a modified version of Mill on some
other project's Mill build.

You can also create a launcher-script to let you run the current checkout of
Mill without the bootstrap Mill process present:

```bash
mill -i dev.launcher
```

This creates the `out/dev/launcher/dest/run` launcher script, which you can then
use to run your current checkout of Mill where-ever you'd like. Note that this
script relies on the compiled code already present in the Mill `out/` folder,
and thus isn't suitable for testing on Mill's own Mill build since you would be
over-writing the compiled code at the same time as the launcher script is using
it.

You can also run your current checkout of Mill on the build in your `scratch/`
folder without the bootstrap Mill process being present via:

```bash
mill -i dev.launcher && (cd scratch && ../out/dev/launcher/dest/run -w show thingy)
```

### Bootstrapping: Building Mill with your current checkout of Mill

To test bootstrapping of Mill's own Mill build using a version of Mill built
from your checkout, you can run

```bash
ci/publish-local.sh
```

This creates a standalone assembly at `~/mill-release` you can use, which
references jars published locally in your `~/.ivy2/local` cache. You can then
use this standalone assembly to build & re-build your current Mill checkout
without worrying about stomping over compiled code that the assembly is using.

### Troubleshooting

In case of troubles with caching and/or incremental compilation, you can always
restart from scratch removing the `out` directory:

```bash
rm -rf out/
```

## Project Layout

The Mill project is organized roughly as follows:

### Core modules that are included in the main assembly

- `core`, `main`, `main.client`, `scalalib`, `scalajslib`.

These are general lightweight and dependency-free: mostly configuration & wiring
of a Mill build and without the heavy lifting.

Heavy lifting is delegated to the worker modules (described below), which the
core modules resolve from Maven Central (or from the local filesystem in
dev) and load into isolated classloaders.

### Worker modules that are resolved from Maven Central

- `scalalib.worker`, `scalajslib.jsbridges[0.6]`, `scalajslib.jsbridges[1.0]`

These modules are where the heavy-lifting happens, and include heavy
dependencies like the Scala compiler, Scala.js optimizer, etc.. Rather than
being bundled in the main assembly & classpath, these are resolved separately
from Maven Central (or from the local filesystem in dev) and kept in isolated
classloaders.

This allows a single Mill build to use multiple versions of e.g. the Scala.js
optimizer without classpath conflicts.


## Changelog

### 0.2.5

- Add `.runBackground` and `.runMainBackground` commands, to run something in
  the background without waiting for it to return. The process will keep running
  until it exits normally, or until the same `.runBackground` command is run a
  second time to spawn a new version of the process. Can be used with `-w` for
  auto-reloading of long-running servers.

- [Scala-Native support](http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/page/common-project-layouts.html#scala-native-modules).
  Try it out!

- Allow passing Ammonite command-line options to the `foo.repl` command
  ([333](https://github.com/lihaoyi/mill/pull/333))

  `foo.run` fails

- ScalaFmt support ([308](https://github.com/lihaoyi/mill/pull/308))

### 0.1.7
 
- Support for non-interactive (client/server) mode on Windows.

- More fixes for Java 9

- Bumped the Mill daemon timeout from 1 minute to 5 minutes of inactivity before
  it shuts down.

- Avoid leaking Node.js subprocesses when running `ScalaJSModule` tests

- Passing command-line arguments with spaces in them to tests no longer parses
  wrongly

- `ScalaModule#repositories`, `scalacPluginIvyDeps`, `scalacOptions`,
  `javacOptions` are now automatically propagated to `Tests` modules

- `ScalaJSModule` linking errors no longer show a useless stack trace

- `ScalaModule#docJar` now properly uses the compileClasspath rather than
  runClasspath

- Bumped underlying Ammonite version to [1.1.0](http://ammonite.io/#1.1.0),
  which provides the improved Windows and Java 9 support

### 0.1.6

- Fixes for non-interactive (client/server) mode on Java 9

- Windows batch (.bat) generation for launcher, assembly, and release

### 0.1.5

- Introduced the `mill plan foo.bar` command, which shows you what the execution
  plan of running the `foo.bar` task looks like without actually evaluating it.

- Mill now generates an `out/mill-profile.json` file containing task-timings, to
  make it easier to see where your mill evaluation time is going
  
- Introduced `ScalaModule#ivyDepsTree` command to show dependencies tree
  
- Rename `describe` to `inspect` for consistency with SBT

- `mill resolve` now prints results sorted alphabetically

- Scala.js now supports `NoModule` and `CommonJSModule` module kinds

- Include `compileIvyDeps` when generating IntelliJ projects

- Fixed invalid POM generation

- Support for Java 9 (and 10)

- Speed up incremental `assembly`s in the common case where upstream
  dependencies do not change.

- Make `ScalaJSModule#run` work with main-method discovery

- Make `ScalaWorkerModule` user-defineable, so you can use your own custom
  coursier resolvers when resolving Mill's own jars

- Simplify definitions of `SCM` strings

- Make the build REPL explicitly require `-i`/`--interactive` to run

- Log a message when Mill is initializing the Zinc compiler interface

### 0.1.3

- Greatly reduced the overhead of evaluating Mill tasks, with a warm
  already-cached `mill dev.launcher` now taking ~450ms instead of ~1000ms

- Mill now saves compiled build files in `~/.mill/ammonite`, which is
  configurable via the `--home` CLI arg.

- Fixed linking of multi-module Scala.js projects

### 0.1.2

- Mill now keeps a long-lived work-daemon around in between commands; this
  should improve performance of things like `compile` which benefit from the
  warm JVM. You can use `-i`/`--interactive` for interactive consoles/REPLs and
  for running commands without the daemon

- Implemented the `ScalaModule#launcher` target for easily creating command-line
  launchers you can run outside of Mill

- `ScalaModule#docJar` no longer fails if you don't have `scala-compiler` on
  classpath
