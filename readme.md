Your shiny new Scala build tool! Confused by SBT? Frustrated by Maven? Perplexed
by Gradle? Give Mill a try!

If you want to use Mill in your own projects, check out our documentation:

- [Documentation](http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/)

The remainder of this readme is targeted at people who wish to work on Mill's
own codebase.

## How to build and test

Mill is built using Mill. To begin, first download & install Mill as described
in the documentation above.

To run unit test suite:

```bash
mill main.test
```

Build a standalone executable jar:

```bash
mill dev.assembly
```

Now you can re-build this very same project using the build.sc file, e.g. re-run
core unit tests

e.g.:   
```bash
./out/dev/assembly/dest/mill core.compile
./out/dev/assembly/dest/mill main.test.compile
./out/dev/assembly/dest/mill main.test
./out/dev/assembly/dest/mill scalalib.assembly
```

There is already a `watch` option that looks for changes on files, e.g.:

```bash
./out/dev/assembly/dest/mill --watch core.compile
```

You can get Mill to show the JSON-structured output for a particular `Target` or
`Command` using the `show` flag:

```bash
./out/dev/assembly/dest/mill show core.scalaVersion
./out/dev/assembly/dest/mill show core.compile
./out/dev/assembly/dest/mill show core.assemblyClasspath
./out/dev/assembly/dest/mill show main.test
```

Output will be generated into a the `./out` folder.

If you are repeatedly testing Mill manually by running it against the `build.sc`
file in the repository root, you can skip the assembly process and directly run
it via:

```bash
mill --watch dev.run . main.test
mill --watch dev.run .
```

You can also test out your current Mill code with one of the hello-world example
repos via:

```bash
mill dev.run docs/example-1 foo.run
```

Lastly, you can generate IntelliJ Scala project files using Mill via

```bash
./out/dev/assembly/dest/mill mill.scalalib.GenIdeaModule/idea
```

Allowing you to import a Mill project into Intellij without using SBT

### Command line

There is a number of ways to run targets and commands via command line:

* Run single target:
```bash
mill core.compile
```

* Run single command with arguments:
```bash
mill bridges[2.12.4].publish --credentials foo --gpgPassphrase bar
```

* Run multiple targets:
```bash
mill all main.test scalalib.test 
```

**Note**: don't forget to put `--all` flag when you run multiple commands, otherwise the only first command will be run, and subsequent commands will be passed as arguments to the first one.

* Run multiple commands with arguments:
```bash
mill all bridges[2.11.11].publish bridges[2.12.4].publish -- --credentials foo --gpgPassphrase bar 
```

Here `--credentials foo --gpgPassphrase bar` arguments will be passed to both `bridges[2.11.11].publish` and `bridges[2.12.4].publish` command. 

**Note**: arguments list should be separated with `--` from command list.


Sometimes it is tedious to write multiple targets when you want to run same target in multiple modules, or multiple targets in one module.
Here brace expansion from bash(or another shell that support brace expansion) comes to rescue. It allows you to make some "shortcuts" for multiple commands.

* Run same targets in multiple modules with brace expansion:
```bash
mill all {core,scalalib,scalajslib,integration}.test
```

will run `test` target in `core`, `scalalib`, `scalajslib` and `integration` modules.

* Run multiple targets in one module with brace expansion:
```bash
mill all scalalib.{compile,test}
```

will run `compile` and `test` targets in `scalalib` module.

* Run multiple targets in multiple modules:
```bash
mill all {core,scalalib}.{scalaVersion,scalaBinaryVersion}
```

will run `scalaVersion` and `scalaBinaryVersion` targets in both `core` and `scalalib` modules. 

* Run targets in different cross build modules

```bash
mill all bridges[{2.11.11,2.12.4}].publish --  --credentials foo --gpgPassphrase bar
```

will run `publish` command in both `brides[2.11.11]` and `bridges[2.12.4]` modules

You can also use the `_` wildcard and `__` recursive-wildcard to run groups of
tasks:

```bash
# Run the `test` command of all top-level modules
mill all _.test

# Run the `test` command of all modules, top-level or nested
mill all __.test

# Run `compile` in every cross-module of `bridges`
mill all bridges[_].compile
```

**Note**: When you run multiple targets with `--all` flag, they are not
guaranteed to run in that exact order. Mill will build task evaluation graph and
run targets in correct order.

### REPL

Mill provides a build REPL, which lets you explore the build interactively and
run `Target`s from Scala code:

```scala
$ mill -i

### build.sc

Into a `build.sc` file you can define separate `Module`s (e.g. `ScalaModule`).
Within each `Module` you can define 3 type of task:

- `Target`: take no argument, output is cached and should be serializable; run
  from `bash` (e.g. `def foo = T{...}`)
- `Command`: take serializable arguments, output is not cached; run from `bash`
  (arguments with `scopt`) (e.g. `def foo = T.command{...}`)
- `Task`: take arguments, output is not cached; do not run from `bash` (e.g.
  `def foo = T.task{...}` )


### Structure of the `out/` folder

The `out/` folder contains all the generated files & metadata for your build. It
is structured with one folder per `Target`/`Command`, that is run, e.g.:

- `out/core/compile/`
- `out/main/test/compile/`
- `out/main/test/forkTest/`
- `out/scalalib/compile/`

Each folder currently contains the following files:

- `dest/`: a path for the `Task` to use either as a scratch space, or to place
  generated files that are returned using `PathRef`s. `Task`s should only output
  files within their given `dest/` folder (available as `T.ctx().dest`) to avoid
  conflicting with other `Task`s, but files within `dest/` can be named
  arbitrarily.

- `log`: the `stdout`/`stderr` of the `Task`. This is also streamed to the
  console during evaluation.

- `meta.json`: the cache-key and JSON-serialized return-value of the
  `Target`/`Command`. The return-value can also be retrieved via `mill show
  core.compile`. Binary blobs are typically not included in `meta.json`, and
  instead stored as separate binary files in `dest/` which are then referenced
  by `meta.json` via `PathRef`s

### Troubleshooting

In case of troubles with caching and/or incremental compilation, you can always
restart from scratch removing the `out` directory:

```bash
rm -rf out/
```

## Changelog

### master

- Introduced the `mill plan foo.bar` command, which shows you what the execution
  plan of running the `foo.bar` task looks like without actually evaluating it.

- Mill now generates an `out/mill-profile.json` file containing task-timings, to
  make it easier to see where your mill evaluation time is going

### 0.1.4

- Speed up Mill client initialization by another 50-100ms

- Speed up incremental `assembly`s in the common case where upstream
  dependencies do not change.

- Make `ScalaJSModule#run` work with main-method discovery

- Make `ScalaWorkerModule` user-defineable, so you can use your own custom
  coursier resolvers when resolving Mill's own jars

- Simplify definitions of `SCM` strings

- Make the build REPL explicitly require `-i`/`--interactive` to run

- Log a message when Mill is initializing the Zinc compiler interface

### 0.1.3

- Greatly reduced the overhead of evaluating Mill tasks, with a warm
  already-cached `mill dev.launcher` now taking ~450ms instead of ~1000ms

- Mill now saves compiled build files in `~/.mill/ammonite`, which is
  configurable via the `--home` CLI arg.

- Fixed linking of multi-module Scala.js projects

### 0.1.2

- Mill now keeps a long-lived work-daemon around in between commands; this
  should improve performance of things like `compile` which benefit from the
  warm JVM. You can use `-i`/`--interactive` for interactive consoles/REPLs and
  for running commands without the daemon

- Implemented the `ScalaModule#launcher` target for easily creating command-line
  launchers you can run outside of Mill

- `ScalaModule#docJar` no longer fails if you don't have `scala-compiler` on
  classpath

- Support for multiple `testFrameworks` in a test module.

### 0.1.1

- Fixes for `foo.console`
- Enable Ammonite REPL integration via `foo.repl`

### 0.1.0

- First public release
