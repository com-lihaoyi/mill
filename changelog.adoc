:version: 0.12.6
:milestone-name: 0.12.6
:milestone: 109
:prev-version: 0.12.5

* https://mill-build.org/mill/cli/installation-ide.html#_mill_native_executable[Mill now provides native executables] on windows-amd64, linux-{amd64,aarch64}, and
macos-{amd64,aarch64}. These can be enabled by adding the `-native` suffix to your `.mill-version`
file (e.g. `0.12.6-native`), and allows you to run Mill on clean machines without needing
a pre-installed JVM (Mill will instead download one as necessary)

** Using Mill native binaries requires the latest `./mill` or `./mill.bat` files,
available for download in the Mill repo (https://mill-build.org/mill/cli/installation-ide.html#_bootstrap_scripts[Docs])

** windows-aarch64 is not supported due to limitations in the upstream Graal native
image builder https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/9215[]

* Mill also provides support for users to build native images via `NativeImageModule` (https://mill-build.org/mill/javalib/publishing.html#_building_native_image_binaries_with_graal_vm[Docs])

* Mill's https://mill-build.org/mill/pythonlib/intro.html[Python support] {link-pr}/4166[#4166]
  is no longer experimental and is ready for people to use. It is still
  in development, so please try it out and let us know if you hit issues!

* Support for semi-automated migration from Gradle to Mill via `mill init` (https://mill-build.org/mill/migrating/gradle.html[Docs]) {link-pr}/4363[#4363]

* Overhaul of the JVM module dependency resolution logic, delegating it mostly upstream
to Coursier rather than implementing it in Mill {link-pr}/4145[#4145]

* Allow users to define and publish their own BOM in Mill (https://mill-build.org/mill/fundamentals/library-deps.html#_dependency_management[Docs]) {link-pr}/4155[#4155]

* Reduce Java Heap for Mill Client to reduce memory footprint {link-pr}/4163[#4163]

* Catch fatal exceptions in futures to prevent hangs {link-pr}/4223[#4223]

* Use `check=true` for ktlint checkFormatAll run {link-pr}/4247[#4247]

`.fix` on modules without suorces {link-pr}/4249[#4249]

* Honor the `NO_COLOR` env variable {link-pr}/4246[#4246]

* Fix race condition that occasionally caused Mill's background server to exit and
restart unnecessarily {link-pr}/4254[#4254]

  Android support] {link-pr}/4188[#4188] {link-pr}/4261[#4261] {link-pr}/4277[#4277]

* Improvements to Mill's https://mill-build.org/mill/javascriptlib/intro.html[experimental
  Javascript/Typescript support] {link-pr}/4253[#4253] {link-pr}/4293[#4293]

* Detect terminal size on windows using `io.github.alexarchambault.windowsansi`
{link-pr}/4056[#4056]

* Make `runBackground` work with `-i`/`--no-server`, rather than exiting immediately
{link-pr}/4259[#4259]

* Fix using `clean` to terminate `runBackground` subprocesses on windows
{link-pr}/4265[#4265]

* Add `selective.resolveChanged` {link-pr}/4358[#4358] and `selective.resolveTree`
{link-pr}/4349[#4349] tasks to help debug selective execution issues

* Add `dockerEnv` target to customize environment passed to `docker` command {link-pr}/3257[#3257]

* Mill bootstrap scripts and example zips have been moved from Github Releases
to Maven Central for improved security and reliability {link-pr}/4372[#4372]

:version: 0.12.4
:milestone-name: 0.12.4
:milestone: 107
:prev-version: 0.12.3

* Mill now supports https://mill-build.org/mill/large/selective-execution.html[Selective Execution],
allowing you to run tests and other tasks only if they are downstream of a code change.
This can be used to greatly speed up pull-request validation and other CI workflows
by skipping unrelated tests that cannot possibly be broken by the code change in question

* Mill now generates https://mill-build.org/mill/fundamentals/out-dir.html#_mill_dependency_tree_json[dependency-tree.json]
and https://mill-build.org/mill/main-branch/fundamentals/out-dir.html#_mill_invalidation_tree_json[invalidation-tree.json]
metadata for every run, which should help make it easier for a user to figure out why a task
is being selected and run.

* Support for Bill-Of-Materials/Dependency-Management when downloading third-party JVM dependencies
(https://mill-build.org/mill/main-branch/javalib/dependencies.html#_dependency_management[Documentation])

* Built-in support for `mill.bat` launcher to run Mill natively on a Windows environment
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/pull/4052[#4052]

* Added documentation for https://mill-build.org/mill/migrating/migrating.html[Migrating to Mill],
to try and help people who may be trying to move their existing codebase onto Mill from other build tools

* Significant speedups for task resolution logic https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/pull/4132[#4132],
which should speed up cached-build workflows in particular

* Improve precision of code signature task invalidation, reducing the amount of spurious
task invalidations in the presence of multi-file builds https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/pull/4113[#4113]
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/pull/4116[#4116]

* Reduced overhead of terminal prompt UI https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/pull/4095[#4095]
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/pull/4110[#4110]

* Launch of the https://mill-build.org/blog[Mill Build Engineering Blog], where we will post articles
discussing topics around JVM build tooling

[#0-12-0]
=== 0.12.0 - 2024-10-23

The Mill 0.12.0 release focuses on improving the scalability of Mill builds: in terms
of performance, code organization, adherence to best practices, and community.

Major changes:

1. Mill now runs tasks parallel by default, rather than opt-in. This includes a
new parallel-friendly terminal UI, https://mill-build.org/mill/Mill_Sandboxing.html[task
   and test sandboxing] to guard against race conditions,
xref:javalib/testing.adoc#_test_grouping[parallelization of test suites],
and other measures optimizing for parallel builds

2. Mill now uses `build.mill` rather than `build.sc` as the primary file extension, to avoid
confusion with Scala-CLI or Ammonite scripts, and the `T`/`T.worker`/`T.input` syntax
has been deprecated in favor of `Task`/`Task.Worker`/`T.Input` for a more idiomatic style

3. Mill now supports for https://mill-build.org/mill/Structuring_Large_Builds.html[Modularizing Large Builds]
into multiple `package.mill` files, to help support large codebases and incremental compilation
of the build files.

4. Mill now provides official support for https://mill-build.org/mill/Writing_Mill_Plugins.html[Writing Mill Plugins],
with tested workflows and an official testkit to help you write and publish your own Mill
plugins for others to use

5. Mill now supports other JVM langauges: https://mill-build.org/mill/javalib/intro.html[Java],
experimental support for https://mill-build.org/mill/kotlinlib/intro.html[Kotlin/KotlinJs],
and https://mill-build.org/mill/android/kotlin.html[even-more-experimental support for Android].
This includes IDE integrations, tooling integrations (docs, autoformatters, linters, testing
frameworks, etc.)

6. The Mill doc-site at https://mill-build.org/ has undergone a massive overhaul.
New comparisons with other build tools of (https://mill-build.org/mill/comparisons/maven.html[Maven],
https://mill-build.org/mill/comparisons/gradle.html[Gradle],
https://mill-build.org/mill/comparisons/sbt.html[`sbt`]), documentation for
https://mill-build.org/mill/extending/new-language.html[adding new language toolchains]
and https://mill-build.org/mill/extending/running-jvm-code.html[running dynamic JVM code],
and re-organized the pages for Scala/Java/Kotlin by-use-case to make them more navigable

For a more detailed view of Mill changes since 0.11.12, along with migration instructions,
see the sections below on:

* <<0-12-0-RC1>>
* <<0-12-0-RC2>>
* <<0-12-0-RC3>>
* <<0-12-0-since-rc2>>

0.12.x is binary compatible with 0.11.x, and so Mill plugins published for Mill 0.11.x can
continue to be used without updating them. Although binary compatible, Mill 0.12.x does
have breaking changes listed below with instructions provided on how to either disable the
breaking change with a flag or adjust your code to accommodate it. You should download the
latest version of the https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/blob/main/mill[Mill Bootstrap Script]
if you are upgrading from a prior version.

If you need help upgrading from 0.11.x or hit any issues, please visit the
https://discord.com/invite/xJCYRVMS[#mill Discord Channel] or
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/discussions/3349[0.12.x Github Discussion Thread]. We'd
love to hear from you on your experience with Mill in general and Mil 0.12.x in particular

* *Example Upgrade PRs*

** The following PRs are example upgrades of Mill from 0.11.x to 0.12.0-RC1 for various
projects in the `com.lihaoyi` ecosystem.

[#0-12-0-since-rc2]
==== 0.12.0 Changes since RC3

* Mill now takes a lock on the `out/` folder whenver evaluating it to avoid race conditions on disk.
{link-pr}/3599[#3599]. Pass in `--no-build-lock` to disable it at your own risk

* Update Zinc to 0.10.3 to fix issues with over-compilation {link-pr}/3748[#3748]

* `runIvyDeps` is now transitive, as is the newly-introduced `runModuleDeps`,
to try and match the semantics of runtime deps in Maven{link-pr}/3774[#3774]

[#0-12-0-RC3]
==== 0.12.0-RC3 - 2024-10-04

Changes since 0.12.0-RC2

* `-j`/`--jobs` now allows computed values of the form `-j 0.5C` (half as many jobs as cores) or
`-j C-2` (two less jobs than cores) to allow for automatic scaling based on the number of cores available
{link-pr}/3554[#3554]


* Fix `testOnly` handling of ScalaTest tagged tests {link-pr}/3557[#3557]

* Make `./mill` without any arguments point you towards --help, flesh out --help into a cheat sheet {link-pr}/3556[#3556]

* Use `Task` instead of `T` when constructing targets and other tasks {link-pr}/3565[#3565]. The new syntax
(given below) is intended to be more idiomatic Scala and less idiosyncratic. The old syntax will continue
to work for backwards compatibility, but using the new syntax is recommended
** `T {...}` ->  `Task {...}`
** `T.command {...}` ->  `Task.Command {...}`
** `T.input {...}` ->  `Task.Input {...}`
** `T.source {...}` ->  `Task.Source {...}`
** `T.sources {...}` ->  `Task.Sources {...}`
** `T.persistent {...}` ->  `Task(persistent = true) {...}`
** `T.task {...}` ->  `Task.Anon {...}`

* Introduced `Task.Command(exclusive = true)` to allow explicit annotation of which
commands need to run without parallelism, allowing `.test` and other commands
to run parallel by default {link-pr}/3617[#3617]

* Lots of added docs for Building Kotlin with Mill:
** Kotlin Build Examples and Linting {link-pr}/3555[#3555], with KtLint and Detekt support
** Kotlin Module Configuration {link-pr}/3585[#3585]
** Publishing and Testing Kotlin with Mill {link-pr}/3589[#3589]
** Using Mill to build a Ktor web server  {link-pr}/3621[#3621]

* Additional support for Kotlin tools and frameworks
** KtFmt support  {link-pr}/3620[#3620]
** Kover support  {link-pr}/3624[#3624]

* Show Worker tasks in `resolve`/`show`/`inspect` {link-pr}/3580[#3580]

* `mill clean` now terminates Worker tasks {link-pr}/3579[#3579]

* Overhaul of the terminal "ticker" UI for displaying task progress to better support
parallel builds {link-pr}/3577[#3577]
** Mill now shows all active tasks and their duration at the bottom of your terminal
** Stream task logs are now prefixed with the task index on the left and the task
name above, so you can attribute each line of logs to the task that generated it

* Add API for tasks to spawn concurrent and parallel futures via `Task.fork.{async,await}` {link-pr}/3478[#3478]

* Allow large test modules with many classes to be broken up to use multiple concurrent JVMs
by overriding `def testForkGrouping` {link-pr}/3478[#3478]

* Use coursier thread pool to run coursier-related tasks to avoid deadlocks {link-pr}/3614[#3614]

* `inspect` now shows useful information when used on modules, not just tasks {link-pr}/3532[#3532]

```
$ ./mill inspect dist0
dist0(build.mill:745)
    Version of [[dist]] meant for local integration testing within the Mill
    repo. Looks mostly the same as [[dist]], except it does not have a reference
    to itself in its [[testTransitiveDeps]], to avoid a circular dependency.

Inherited Modules: MillPublishJavaModule

Module Dependencies: runner, idea

Default Task: dist0.run

Tasks: dist0.fix, dist0.testTransitiveDeps
```

* `mill init` now supports creating a project based on examples from Mill's documentation {link-pr}/3583[#3583],
and unpacks the example into the current folder rather than a subfolder {link-pr}/3626[#3626]

* `MILL_TEST_RESOURCE_FOLDER` has been renamed to `MILL_TEST_RESOURCE_DIR` for consistency with other
environment variable names {link-pr}/3637[#3637]

[#0-12-0-RC2]
==== 0.12.0-RC2 - 2024-09-16

Changes since 0.12.0-RC1

* Support `exclude` attribute in `Dep` parser. You can give exclusions with `;exclude=org:name`
or `;exclude=org:*` or `;exclude=*:name` {link-pr}/3492[#3492]

* Fix `ScalaModule#console` by properly inheriting streams {link-pr}/3500[#3500]

* Adjust codegen to allow custom ``mainargs.TokensReader``s, and include a
`mainargs.TokensReader[os.Path]` by default for convenience {link-pr}/3504[#3504]

* Update to https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/os-lib?tab=readme-ov-file#0-10-7[OS-Lib 0.10.7] to
allow concise multi-segment sub-paths; you can now write `os.pwd / "foo/bar/qux"` rather than
`os.pwd / "foo/bar/qux"`

* Add `JavaModule.mandatoryJavacOptions`. Those are not propagated to the inner test
traits intentionally, since those options are typically configured by other means,
e.g. dedicated targets. {link-pr}/3503[#3503]

* Add plugins to run Checkstyle and generate reports {link-pr}/3516[#3516]

* Simplified ``PublishModule``'s publishing setup via  {link-pr}/3523[#3523]. You can now
run `mill mill.scalalib.PublishModule/` with the proper environment variables (below) and
it should do the right thing by default

** Prefix all environment variables with `MILL_`:
`MILL_SONATYPE_USERNAME`, `MILL_SONATYPE_PASSWORD`,
`MILL_PGP_SECRET_BASE64`, `MILL_PGP_PASSPHRASE` to try and add some
rudimentary ownership and namespacing

* Allow external modules to have a `defaultCommandName` {link-pr}/3545[#3545]. This has
been applied to `ScalafmtModule` and `PublishModule`, so you can
now autoformat your code via `mill mill.scalalib.ScalafmtModule/` and publish it via
`mill mill.scalalib.PublishModule/` without needing the `/reformatAll __.sources`
or `/publishAll __.publishArtifacts` suffix

* Integrated Kotlin integration as a first partly module and add example documentation
{link-pr}/3514[#3514]. This is still pretty spartan, but we expect to flesh it out over time

* Move `.mill.sc` alternate file extension to `.mill.scala` {link-pr}/3521[#3521]

[#0-12-0-RC1]
==== 0.12.0-RC1 - 2024-09-09

* *Breaking Changes*

** Build file overhaul: Mill's build file management has been overhauled to better support
large projects. See https://mill-build.org/mill/Structuring_Large_Builds.html[Structuring Large Builds]
for details

*** Mill now uses `.mill` as its file extension, with some semantic changes
from the old `.sc` files to allow better IDE support. The `.sc` extension is still supported
and its semantics are largely unchanged the ease the migration, but you should convert your Mill
configs to `.mill` files to benefit from Mill's improved IDE experience going forward.

*** The `build.sc` file has been renamed `build.mill` to prevent confusion with Ammonite/Scala-CLI scripts,
and all associated `.sc` files have been renamed to `.mill`.

**** Until IntelliJ-Scala adds support for `.mill` files built in, you can add it yourself via
`Settings / Editor / File Types / Scala` and add the pattern `*.mill`

*** All `.mill` files must have a `package` declaration,
with `package build` for `.mill` files in the root folder and `package build.foo.bar` for `.mill` files in `foo/bar/`.

**** The package declaration remains optional for legacy `.sc` files

*** Only `foo.mill` files in folders directly containing a `build.mill` or `package.mill` can
be imported via `import $file`.

**** You need to create empty `package.mill` files in any folder containing scripts if they are not already
adjacent to your `build.mill` in the root folder

**** `foo.sc` files can continue to be imported from arbitrary paths, to ease in the migration

*** Builds can now be modularized into per-folder definitions by defining `package.mill` files in subfolders
{link-pr}/3213[#3213]. You can no longer define targets and modules in arbitrary `foo.sc` files

**** All target and module definitions must be moved into `package.mill` files in each folder.

*** `$file` references in `.mill` files are now absolute from the project root, and thus `.^` to
refer to parent package is no longer supported, for consistency with other programming environments

**** `$file` references in old `.sc` files are unchanged and continue being relative, preserving the
current behavior.

** ``RootModule``s can only be named `package`, e.g. `object foo extends RootModule` must now be
named ``object `package` extends RootModule``.

*** If you have an existing `RootModule`, you need to rename it ``object `package` extends RootModule``

** Turn on parallelism for task evaluation by default, except for commands
which always run serially at the end {link-pr}/3265[#3265]

*** This can be disabled by passing `--jobs 1`

** Mill uses empty sandbox folders as the working directory for running its own code and
{link-pr}/3367[#3367] and test suites {link-pr}/3347[#3347], to avoid accidental interference
between tasks and tests due to parallelism. See https://mill-build.org/mill/Mill_Sandboxing.html[Mill Sandboxing]
for details

*** This can be disabled by adding `def testSandboxWorkingDir = false` in your test module

** Mill commands now require arguments to be passed named via `./mill mycommand --key value`, rather than
allowing just `./mill mycommand value`. {link-pr}/3431[#3431].

*** You can pass in
`--allow-positional-command-args` to fall back to the old behavior, or use `@mainargs.arg(positional = true)`
on individual parameters

** Dropped support for Java 8, Scala 2.11.x/3.1.x, and Scala-Native 0.4.x, following suit with the rest of the
com-lihaoyi ecosystem. We now expect a minimum of Java 11, Scala 2.12.x/3.2.x, and Scala-Native 0.5.x

** `--disable-callgraph-invalidation` is no longer supported. The flag is still accepted but is
now a no-op.

* *Other Changes*

** Overhaul the Mill client-server protocol to improve robustness
{link-pr}/3363[#3363] {link-pr}/3366[#3366] {link-pr}/3368[#3368] {link-pr}/3370[#3370]

** Mill now has explicitly supported workflows for third-party plugin authors, and
publishes unit, integration, and example test fixtures for writing plugins as `mill-testkit`
{link-pr}/3398[#3398] for downstream plugin authors to use in testing their own Mill extensions.

*** See https://mill-build.org/mill/Writing_Mill_Plugins.html[Writing Mill Plugins] for more details.

*** `mill-testkit` is experimental and does not provide the same stability or binary-compatibility
guarantees as the rest of Mill. Nevertheless, if you are writing Mill plugins, please try it out
and let us know what you think!

** Bump default Sonatype Maven Central publishing timeouts to 10 minutes to avoid
timeouts due to slowness https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/commit/b4c9386b0233fab53a312426715e226e4a7f6302

** Importing Mill projects into IntelliJ via BSP now properly marks the `out/`, `.idea/`, and `.bsp/` folders
as excluded {link-pr}/3329[#3329]

** Optimizations to Mill evaluation logic to reduce fixed overhead of running Mill
on large projects {link-pr}/3388[#3388]

** Improvements to `visualize` and `visualizePlan` such that they no longer need to be
prefixed with `show` and no longer need a separate `graphviz`/`dot` install on Mac-OSX

`JavaModule` support, and allowing Javadoc/Scaladoc comments to be associated with the generated `BuildInfo` constants {link-pr}/2425[#2425]

* Global Configuration via `~/.mill/ammonite/predefScript.sc` is no longer supported in this version.
If that breaks your workflow, please report and tell us your use case so we can provide sufficient replacement or support for your use case before Mill 0.11.

* Overhaul of the documentation.
Created many executable example projects which are included in the documentation and run/tested on CI

* Change cross module definitions to be traits instead of classes, for greater regularity and less builerplate at call sites. _This change requires slight modification to existing build scripts that define cross modules._
