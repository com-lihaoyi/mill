_{author}, {revdate}_

One recent development is the ability to compile Java programs into self-contained
native binaries. This provides more convenient
single-file distributions, faster startup time, and lower memory footprint, at a cost of
slower creation time and limitations around reflection and dynamic classloading. This
article explores how you can get started building your Java program into a native binary,
using the xref:mill:ROOT:index.adoc[Mill build tool] and the
https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/[Graal _native-image_ compiler],
and how to think about the benefits and challenges of doing so.


// end::header[]

== An Example Java Program

To get started building a Java native binary, we will use the following example program:

*foo/src/foo/Foo.java*

[source,java]
----
package foo;

import net.sourceforge.argparse4j.ArgumentParsers;
import net.sourceforge.argparse4j.inf.ArgumentParser;
import net.sourceforge.argparse4j.inf.Namespace;
import org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine;
import org.thymeleaf.context.Context;

public class Foo {
  public static String generateHtml(String text) {
    Context context = new Context();
    context.setVariable("text", text);
    return new TemplateEngine().process("<h1 th:text=\"${text}\"></h1>", context);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArgumentParser parser = ArgumentParsers.newFor("template")
        .build()
        .defaultHelp(true)
        .description("Inserts text into a HTML template");

    parser.addArgument("-t", "--text").required(true).help("text to insert");

    Namespace ns = null;
    try {
      ns = parser.parseArgs(args);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println(e.getMessage());
      System.exit(1);
    }

    System.out.println(generateHtml(ns.getString("text")));
  }
}
----

`Foo.java` is a simple Java program with two dependencies - https://argparse4j.github.io/[ArgParse4J]
and https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] - that takes input via CLI flags and generates an
HTML snippet it prints to stdout. While a bit contrived, this is intended to be a simple
program using common third-party dependencies.

To build `Foo.java` using Mill, we can use the following build configuration:

*.mill-version*

[source]
----
0.12.6
----

*build.mill*

[source,scala]
----
package build
import mill._, javalib._
import mill.define.ModuleRef

object foo extends JavaModule {
  def ivyDeps = Seq(
    ivy"net.sourceforge.argparse4j:argparse4j:0.9.0",
    ivy"org.thymeleaf:thymeleaf:3.1.1.RELEASE",
    ivy"org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:2.0.7"
  )
}
----

Now, using a `./mill` xref:mill:ROOT:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_bootstrap_scripts[bootstrap script],
we can run this program as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mill foo.run --text "hello-world"
[55/55] foo.run
[55] <h1>hello-world</h1>
----

Or turn it into an xref:5-executable-jars.adoc[Executable Assembly Jar] that can be run
outside of the build tool:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mill show foo.assembly
".../out/foo/assembly.dest/out.jar"

$ out/foo/assembly.dest/out.jar --text "hello world"
<h1>hello world</h1>
----

== Building a Native Image Binary

To use Mill to build a Graal Native Image out of `Foo.java`, we need to tweak the config
above:

*build.mill*

[source,scala]
----
package build
import mill._, javalib._
import mill.define.ModuleRef

object foo extends JavaModule with NativeImageModule {
  def ivyDeps = Seq(
    ivy"net.sourceforge.argparse4j:argparse4j:0.9.0",
    ivy"org.thymeleaf:thymeleaf:3.1.1.RELEASE",
    ivy"org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:2.0.7"
  )

  def zincWorker = ModuleRef(ZincWorkerGraalvm)

  def nativeImageOptions = Seq(
    "--no-fallback",
    "-H:IncludeResourceBundles=net.sourceforge.argparse4j.internal.ArgumentParserImpl"
  )
}

object ZincWorkerGraalvm extends ZincWorkerModule {
  def jvmId = "graalvm-community:23.0.1"
}
----

Notable changes:

- `foo` now needs to inherit from `NativeImageModule`

- We need to override `zincWorker` to point at our own custom `ZincWorkerGraalvm`,
  using the version of Graal that we want to use to build our native image.
  This uses Mill's ability to xref:mill:ROOT:fundamentals/configuring-jvm-versions.adoc[]
  to download the necessary Graal distribution as necessary

- We need to pass in some `nativeImageOptions`: in this case `--no-fallback` and
  `-H:IncludeResourceBundles`, the latter of which is necessary to support
  the ArgParse4J library that the example project depends on

Now, we can use build a native image using `foo.nativeImage`:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mill show foo.nativeImage
".../out/foo/nativeImage.dest/native-executable"

$ out/foo/nativeImage.dest/native-executable --text "hello world"
<h1>hello world</h1>
----

You can download this example below:

* xref:mill:ROOT:javalib/publishing.adoc#_building_native_image_binaries_with_graal_vm[Building Native Image Binaries with Graal VM]

You can also access the `native-image` tool directly from the Mill download folder,
if you want to use it directly or view its `--help` documentation:

[source,bash]
----
$ ~/Github/mill/mill show foo.nativeImageTool
".../graalvm-community-openjdk-17.0.9+9.1/Contents/Home/bin/native-image"

$ .../graalvm-community-openjdk-17.0.9+9.1/Contents/Home/bin/native-image --help
GraalVM Native Image (https://www.graalvm.org/native-image/)

This tool can ahead-of-time compile Java code to native executables.

Usage: native-image [options] class [imagename] [options]
           (to build an image for a class)
   or  native-image [options] -jar jarfile [imagename] [options]
           (to build an image for a jar file)
   or  native-image [options] -m <module>[/<mainclass>] [options]
       native-image [options] --module <module>[/<mainclass>] [options]
           (to build an image for a module)

where options include:

    @argument files       one or more argument files containing options
    -cp <class search path of directories and zip/jar files>\
...

== Native Image v.s. Executable Assembly

At a glance, the difference between the traditional executable assembly
and the Graal native image we built above can be summarized below:

|===
| | Executable Assembly | Native Image
| Creation Time | 0.8s | 24.7s
| Executable Size | 2.5mb | 17mb
| Startup Time | 235ms | 62ms
| Steady State Performance | 190 iter/s | 180 iter/s
| Memory Footprint | 373mb | 20mb
| JVM required to run | Yes | No
| OS/CPU-Specific executable | No | Yes
|===

The remainder of this section will dive into the details of how each number was measured,
and a discussion of what these changes really mean.


=== Creation Time

JVM Executable assemblies are generally very cheap to create, whereas Graal native
image executables can take very long. For this tiny example project, we can see below
that the executable assembly takes about ~1s to create, while the native image takes ~25s:

_Executable Assembly_

[source,bash]
----
$ time ./mill show foo.assembly
[1-41] [info] compiling 1 Java source...
".../out/foo/assembly.dest/out.jar"
./mill show foo.assembly  0.12s user 0.06s system 21% cpu 0.818 total

_Native Image_

----
$ time ./mill show foo.nativeImage

".../out/foo/nativeImage.dest/native-executable"
./mill show foo.nativeImage  0.70s user 1.11s system 7% cpu 24.762 total
----

=== Executable Size

Graal native image binaries are typically larger than the equivalent executable assembly:

[source,bash]
----
$ ls -lh out/foo/assembly.dest/out.jar
-rwxr-xr-x  1 lihaoyi  staff   2.5M Jan 16 15:33 out/foo/assembly.dest/out.jar
----

[source,bash]
----
$ ls -lh out/foo/nativeImage.dest/native-executable
-rwxr-xr-x  1 lihaoyi  staff    17M Jan 16 15:34 out/foo/nativeImage.dest/native-executable
----

Here, the assembly `out.jar` is ~2.5mb, while the native `native-executable` is ~17mb,
even for a tiny hello-world application using some trivial libraries. In general native
image binaries can be pretty large, which can have consequences in download sizes or deployment
times as you try to distribute these binaries to servers or users.

=== Startup Time

Executable assembly jars typically take longer than Graal native executables to run. For this
small example project, we can see the Executable assembly takes about ~235ms to run, while
the native image takes ~60ms

_Executable Assembly_

[source,bash]
----
$ time ./out/foo/assembly.dest/out.jar --text hello-world
<h1>hello-world</h1>
./out/foo/assembly.dest/out.jar --text hello-world
0.35s user 0.04s system 165% cpu 0.235 total
----

_Native Image_

[source,bash]
----
$ time ./out/foo/nativeImage.dest/native-executable --text hello-world
<h1>hello-world</h1>
./out/foo/nativeImage.dest/native-executable --text hello-world
0.04s user 0.01s system 87% cpu 0.062 total
----

The `~175ms` speedup shown is for a tiny example program, and can be expected to grow
for larger Java applications which normally can take multiple seconds to start up.
Nevertheless, whether this speedup is significant depends on the use case: for long-lived
webservers saving a few seconds on startup may not matter, but for short-lived command
line tools this startup overhead may dominate the actual work the program is trying to do,
and saving 100s to 1000s of milliseconds with a native binary can be worthwhile.
The xref:mill:ROOT:index.adoc[Mill build tool] itself is distributed as native binaries:
this saves Mill ~100-200ms every time it is run from the command line, which goes a long
way to ensuring it feels snappy and responsive to users.


=== Steady-State Performance

To do a rough benchmark of the steady-state performance of the executable assembly and
native executable, we can adjust our Java program to run the same logic in a loop, and
every ~1s print out how many iterations of the loop have occurred:

[source,diff]
----
   public static void main(String[] args) {
+    long count = 0;
+    long prevTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
+    String global = null;
+    while(count >= 0){
       ArgumentParser parser = ArgumentParsers.newFor("template")
           .build()
           .defaultHelp(true)
@@ -28,7 +32,15 @@ public class Foo {
         System.out.println(e.getMessage());
         System.exit(1);
       }
+      global = generateHtml(ns.getString("text"));
+      if (System.currentTimeMillis() - prevTime > 1000){
+        prevTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
+        System.out.println(count);
+        count = 0;
+      }
+      count++;
+    }

-    System.out.println(generateHtml(ns.getString("text")));
+    System.out.println(global);
   }
 }
----

Now, if we re-build our assembly and native image and run it, we can see the number
of iterations per second they are able to achieve below:

_Executable Assembly_

[source,bash]
----
$ ./out/foo/assembly.dest/out.jar --text hello-world
135
170
178
188
191
192
192
189
190
188
195
185
182
----

_Native Image_

[source,bash]
----
$ time ./out/foo/nativeImage.dest/native-executable --text hello-world
171
163
180
173
182
182
181
184
181
181
182
183
181
----

As you can see, the executable assembly and native image both have comparable performance,
although the executable assembly starts off lower (135 vs 171) for the first iteration due
to JVM warmup time, but eventually reaches a higher steady state than the native image
(~190 vs ~180).

While again this is for a toy program, for larger applications the same pattern applies: Graal
native binaries avoid the slow startup that JVM applications often exhibit, but in exchange
may not quite reach the same peak steady-state performance that a long-lived JVM application
would typically achieve.

=== Memory Usage

While our programs are looping, we can also see how much memory they take via `top`:

_Executable Assembly_

----

The column `373M` and `20M` are the respective memory footprints of the executable assembly
and native image binary. In this small program, the native image uses almost 20x less memory
than the JVM executable assembly! That is a very significant reduction in resource footprint

=== Portability and Hermeticity

Executable assembly jars require a JVM installed globally in order to run. In a way they are
not hermetic, since the globally-installed JVM can differ resulting in the assembly behaving
differently at runtime. However, it does mean that the executable assembly is typically portable
across different operating systems and CPU architectures: as long as there is a JVM installed,
the executable assembly can be run.

Native images are the opposite: they do not depend on a globally installed JVM, and thus can
be run even in environments where pre-installing a JVM is inconvenient. On the other hand,
the fact that the native executable is OS/CPU-specific means that you need to specifically
generate separate native executables for each platform you want to support.

The Mill build tool takes advantage of this hermeticity for easier installation: it's
xref:mill:ROOT:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_mill_native_executable[Mill Native Executable] can be run on systems without
a JVM installed at all. Mill still needs a JVM later on, e.g. to compile and run user code, and so
the native launcher downloads one on-demand automatically from the
https://github.com/coursier/jvm-index[Coursier JVM Index]. But bootstrapping with a native
launcher means there's one less thing for people to do during setup and installation,
and one less thing to go wrong and cause the user to get stuck.


== Native Image Limitations

Now that we've seen many iof the benefits of Graal native images binaries over
traditional executable assemblies, it's worth discussing the limitations:

=== No Cross Building

Graal can only create native binaries targeting the system on which it is running. That means
that if you want to create binaries for {Linux,Windows,Mac}x{Intel,ARM}, you need 6 different
machines in order to build the 6 binaries and somehow aggregate them together for publication
or deployment. This is not a blocker, but can definitely be inconvenient v.s. some other toolchains
which allow you to build native binaries for all targets on a single machine.

=== No Windows-ARM support

Graal does not support Windows-Arm64 yet (https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/9215). While
that traditionally would not have been a problem, Windows-ARM is getting more popular over time,
with new laptops like my new flagship https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/surface/devices/surface-laptop-7th-edition[Surface Laptop 7]
running on an ARM processor. You simply cannot build Java code into Graal native image binaries
that work on Windows-Arm64 at this time, and thus have to fall back to traditional executable assemblies

=== Creation Performance

Graal native image binaries are much slower to create than executable assemblies, as we saw above:
the example program took ~1s to compile into an executable assembly, but ~25s to compile into
a native image! That means you probably do not want to do day-to-day iterative development on
native images: instead you may want to iterate using traditional JVM assemblies, and only build
native images for integration testing and deployment.

=== Reflection and Dynamic Classloading

Graal native image binaries do not work with Java reflection and dynamic classloading by default, unless
specifically configured. Almost every Java program, library, and framework uses _some_ degree of
reflection and dynamic classloading, and so you do have to spend the effort to configure Graal
appropriately. We saw a glimpse of that above in the `-H:IncludeResourceBundles` flag we needed to
pass to make ArgParse4j work in our toy example, and this will need to be done dozens more times for
any real-world application making heavy use of real-world Java frameworks and libraries.

A full discussion of how to handle reflection and dynamic classloading when building Graal
native images is beyond the scope of this article, but depending on what framework you may be
using there may be existing support.

* Frameworks like https://micronaut.io/[Micronaut]
  or https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] are designed from scratch to minimize reflection to allow native
  image generation

* Older frameworks like
  https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/packaging/native-image/introducing-graalvm-native-images.html[Spring Boot]
  have also introduced support, making it easy to configure Graal to handle the pattern
  of reflection and classloading that the framework performs

== Cross-Publishing Graal Native Binaries on Github Actions

Although Graal doesn't let you cross-build from a single platform, you can still easily
publish artifacts for all supported versions by taking advantage of CI systems like
Github Actions that provide worker machines on different platforms.

For xref:mill:ROOT:index.adoc[Mill], which is distributed as native binaries, we maintain a
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/blob/a383b9c851f4cee55abb3d454c3ecd06853a40b0/.github/workflows/publish-artifacts.yml#L27-L53[matrix of Github actions jobs]
running on Mac, Windows, and Linux to create these binaries and upload them to Maven Central
for users.

        with: { fetch-depth: 0 }

      - run: ./mill -i mill.scalalib.PublishModule/ --publishArtifacts ${{ matrix.publishartifacts }}
----

Note that the default `ubuntu-latest` job publishes `__.publishArtifacts` (all artifacts),
while the other platform-specific jobs publish only `dist.native.publishArtifacts` (the native
artifacts in the `dist.native` folder). This ensures that the non-native jars which are
portable get published only once across all platforms, while the native CPU-specific binary
gets published once per platform

Each job overrides `artifactName` based on `os.name` and `os.arch` such that it publishes to a
different artifact on Maven Central, and we override `def jar` to replace
the default `.jar` artifact with our native image:

[source,scala]
----
def artifactOsSuffix = Task {
  val osName = System.getProperty("os.name").toLowerCase
  if (osName.contains("mac")) "mac"
  else if (osName.contains("windows")) "windows"
  else "linux"
}

def artifactCpuSuffix = Task {
  System.getProperty("os.arch") match {
    case "x86_64" => "amd64"
    case s => s
  }
}

override def artifactName = s"${super.artifactName()}-${artifactOsSuffix()}-${artifactCpuSuffix()}"

override def jar = nativeImage()
----

This results in the following artifacts being published:

[source,bash]
----
# JVM platform-agnostic artifact
com.lihaoyi:mill-dist:0.12.6
# native platform-specific artifacts
com.lihaoyi:mill-dist-native-mac-amd64:0.12.6

com.lihaoyi:mill-dist-native-linux-amd64:0.12.6
com.lihaoyi:mill-dist-native-linux-aarch64:0.12.6
com.lihaoyi:mill-dist-native-windows-amd64:0.12.6
----

These artifacts can be seen online:

- https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=mill-dist[Central Sonatype Search]

And downloaded via

[source,bash]
----
curl https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/lihaoyi/mill-dist-native-mac-aarch64/0.12.6/mill-dist-native-mac-aarch64-0.12.6.jar -o mill-dist-native
chmod +x mill-dist-native
./mill-dist-native version
0.12.6
----

Any application using these binaries can similarly look at the OS/CPU they are running
on and resolve the appropriate executable for them to use.



== Conclusion

Graal native images are a pretty cool technology that give Java developers a new superpower: the
ability to package your Java program into a native binary that can be run without needing a JVM
installed, starts much more quickly, and uses much less memory. There are some caveats around
creation times, binary sizes, and runtime reflection, so they may not be suitable for all
scenarios. But they are a useful tool in the toolbox that helps bridge the gap between the
"Java" world and the world of native command-line tools on Linux, Mac, or Windows.
