Java and other JVM languages like Kotlin or Scala are often used for large enterprise codebases,
but the friction of configuring their build tools means they are less often used for small
programs or scripts. The new release of the Mill build tool v1.1.0 contains two features
that try to improve upon this pain point, allowing your project's to be configured via a
compact `build.mill.yaml` file:

.build.mill.yaml
```yaml
extends: JavaModule
mvnDeps:
- org.jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2
```

Or even together with the program code in a single-file with a `//|` build header comment:

.HtmlScraper.java
```java
//| mvnDeps:
//| - org.jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2
import org.jsoup.Jsoup;
public class HtmlScraper {
  ...
}
```
```console
> ./mill HtmlScraper.java Singapore 1
Hokkien
Conscription_in_Singapore
Malaysia_Agreement
Government_of_Singapore
...
```


This blog post will dive into these two new features: how they work, why they are interesting,
and where they learn from or improve upon existing tools in the JVM ecosystem. We will discuss
how we hope these features will streamline the process of getting started with Java programs,
making Java and other JVM languages the best way to write small-scale programs and scripts.

== The Challenge of Small Java Programs

To understand the pain points of running small Java programs, consider a developer
that has written a single-file Java program they want to run:

.HtmlScraper.java
```java
import org.jsoup.Jsoup;
import java.util.*;

public class HtmlScraper {
  static List<String> fetchLinks(String title) throws Exception {
    var url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" + title;
    var doc = Jsoup.connect(url).header("User-Agent", "My Scraper").get();
    var links = new ArrayList<String>();
    for (var a : doc.select("main p a")) {
      var href = a.attr("href");
      if (href.startsWith("/wiki/")) links.add(href.substring(6));
    }
    return links;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    if (args.length < 2) throw new Exception("HtmlScraper.java <start> <depth>");
    var seen = new HashSet<>(Set.of(args[0]));
    var current = new HashSet<>(Set.of(args[0]));
    for (int i = 0; i < Integer.parseInt(args[1]); i++) {
      var next = new HashSet<String>();
      for (String article : current) {
        for (String link : fetchLinks(article)) {
          if (seen.add(link)) next.add(link);
        }
      }
      current = next;
    }
    for (String s : seen) System.out.println(s);
  }
}
```

This is a simple program that uses the https://jsoup.org/[Jsoup] library to scrape
the links off of a Wikipedia article's HTML page, which it then uses to perform a breadth-first
traversal across the Wikipedia article graph. While a bit contrived, this code is representative
of many of the small programs that may be written in practice:

- A student project
- A one-off prototype
- A small command-line script

In all these cases, the program would have a small amount of code and a few third-party
dependencies. But with traditional build tools like https://maven.apache.org/[Maven], running
such code can be surprisingly involved:

1. Installing Java, which has https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037261[a surprising number of intricacies]
2. Installing Maven
3. Writing out the `pom.xml` (can you write the POM for the above program without copy-paste cargo-culting from StackOverflow/Google/ChatGPT?)
+
.pom.xml
```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>example</groupId>
  <artifactId>html-scraper</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jsoup</groupId>
      <artifactId>jsoup</artifactId>
      <version>1.17.2</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.2.0</version>
        <configuration>
          <mainClass>HtmlScraper</mainClass>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```

4. Running the program using Maven (can you remember the command-line invocation without looking it up?)
+
```console
> mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="Singapore 1"
Hokkien
Conscription_in_Singapore
Malaysia_Agreement
Government_of_Singapore
...
```

None of these are _blockers_: after all we've been building and running Java programs
for decades! There is no doubt most people would be able to get __something__ working
on their machine. But for someone trying to write a small program that can build and
run reliably on their laptop, their colleagues' laptops, their CI machines and their
production environment, these things can end up being surprisingly tricky.

In theory Java and the JVM is a great platform to write and run small programs: easy to learn,
widely used, and a rich standard library and ecosystem of high-quality third-party libraries.
But in practice, this build-tool-setup friction means that people prefer to write their small
programs in Bash, Python, or Node.js rather than writing them in Java, Scala or Kotlin.

== Declarative Mill Builds

The first step Mill 1.1.0 takes towards solving the friction of running small JVM programs is
a new declarative configuration format. That lets us turn the verbose `pom.xml` above into
the declarative `build.mill.yaml` file below:

.build.mill.yaml
```yaml
extends: JavaModule
mvnDeps:
- org.jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2
```

Which you can run via

```console
./mill run <arg1> <arg2>
```

Compared to the equivalent Maven `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`, Mill's `build.mill.yaml` files are
really lightweight, without Maven's reams of XML boilerplate or Gradle's complex Groovy/Kotlin
syntax. `build.mill.yaml` files are as a result easier to write, easier to read, and easier to
maintain compared to other build tools. This also demonstrates that Maven does not have a monopoly
on the idea of _"declarative builds"_, and that it is possible to build upon the same ideas
without being held back by Maven's quirks and idiosyncrasies.

NOTE: `build.mill.yaml` files are written in https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/[YAML 1.2], parsed
using the https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml-engine[SnakeYaml-Engine] library. This helps
mitigate many of the https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell[issues
that YAML has traditionally faced], with YAML 1.2 resolving issues such as the famous
https://www.bram.us/2022/01/11/yaml-the-norway-problem/[Norway Problem] and careful de-serializing
avoiding the mangling of version numbers such as `1.10` to `1.1`. While YAML will always have
edge cases, we expect it will be relatively rare for users to hit YAML-related issues in their
`build.mill.yaml` files.


=== Simplifying Java Project Setup with Mill

Mill's declarative configuration pushes the limits of how easily you can setup a
Java project:

1. Mill's xref:mill::cli/installation-ide.adoc#_bootstrap_scripts[Bootstrap Scripts]
automatically xref:16-zero-setup.adoc[download and cache the right Mill and JVM versions],
so anyone invoking the `./mill` automatically gets  correct versions of Mill, `java`, `javac`,
etc. to work with without needing any prior installation or setup:
+
```console
> ./mill -version
1.1.0

> ./mill java -version
openjdk version "21..." ...

> ./mill javac -version
javac 21...
```

2. Mill's declarative `build.mill.yaml` files are boilerplate-free, which makes them much easier
to write, read, or maintain without relying on copy-paste cargo-culting from
StackOverflow/Google/ChatGPT
+
```yaml
extends: JavaModule
mvnDeps:
- org.jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2
```

3. Mill's CLI syntax for running the code  follows the conventions
established by other CLIs so anyone picking up Mill can use it without the indirection of
learning Maven's unusual command-line conventions
+
```console
./mill run <arg1> <arg2>
```

This solves the 4 frictions we xref:#_the_challenge_of_small_java_programs[mentioned earlier]
in this article, letting you set up a new JVM project easily with a tiny config file and
have it working across different environments and operating systems without needing to fiddle
with JVM or build tool installations.

Like the rest of Mill, its declarative configuration syntax works for
all 3 major JVM languages: xref:mill::javalib/module-config.adoc#_declarative_configuration[Java],
xref:mill::scalalib/module-config.adoc#_declarative_configuration[Scala], and xref:mill::kotlinlib/module-config.adoc#_declarative_configuration[Kotlin].
So anyone using a JVM language, or even multiple JVM languages, can use it to simplify their
project setup and development workflows.


=== Non-Trivial Declarative Builds

While Mill's declarative build files are simpler than its programmable config files, they are
by no means limited to toy projects. `build.mill.yaml` files support most of Mill's
configuration overrides, and below we have
xref:mill::javalib/module-config.adoc#_declarative_configuration[a more verbose example] that
demonstrates many of the common configuration keys a developer may want to set:

.build.mill.yaml
```yaml
extends: [mill.javalib.JavaModule] # fully-qualified module name
mvnDeps:
- org.thymeleaf:thymeleaf:3.1.1.RELEASE
- org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:2.0.7

# Add a custom maven repository URL
repositories: [https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases]

# Set an explicit main class
mainClass: foo.Foo2

# Pin a specific JVM version, supports >=11
jvmVersion: 11
# Optionally specify the distribution: temurin, zulu, corretto, graalvm-community, etc.
# jvmVersion: temurin:11

# Add an additional source folder and resource folder, in addition to the default one
sources: [src/, custom-src/]
resources: [resources/, custom-resources/]

# Configure java compiler and runtime options and env vars
javacOptions: [-deprecation]
forkArgs: [-Dmy.custom.property=my-prop-value]
forkEnv: { MY_CUSTOM_ENV: my-env-value }
```

These keys are all documented in
{mill-doc-url}/api/latest/mill/javalib/JavaModule.html#mvnDeps-0[the API reference],
and are the same keys that Mill's traditional programmable configuration style lets
you override. Mill's declarative builds also support
xref:mill::javalib/testing.adoc[test suites],
xref:mill::javalib/intro.adoc#_multi_module_projects[multi-module projects],
xref:mill::javalib/packaging.adoc[packaging] and xref:mill::javalib/publishing.adoc[publishing],
and other common build tool features. While declarative `build.mill.yaml` files are a lot
simpler and more compact than their equivalent in Maven `pom.xml` or programmable `build.gradle`,
they support just about everything that Maven or Gradle supports, and are featureful enough
to build most real-world projects.

=== Simpler Declarative Builds

We hope Mill's new declarative `build.mill.yaml` syntax can be a
viable alternative to Maven for Java developers who prefer declarative builds, complementing
Mill's existing programmable `build.mill` syntax:

- For most projects that just need basic key-value configuration, Mill's declarative
  `build.mill.yaml` files bring out the best parts of Maven's declarative config without
  the verbosity and clunkiness

- For projects that need custom build logic, programmable `build.mill` files can provide the
  necessary flexibility to get what you need done more easily than with Maven plugins, or
  custom Gradle or SBT tasks

Traditionally, you were locked into a declarative or programmable style when choosing between
Maven or Gradle. This made it a big, irreversible decision, and the root of many "holy wars". In
contrast, with Mill you can easily transition between declarative and programmable configuration
styles as appropriate, even using both in different parts of the same project where appropriate.
This lets you pick whatever style makes sense at the moment knowing that you can
easily incorporate the other style later as necessary.

Beyond simplifying your build file format and command-line interface, Mill 1.1.0 has one more
trick to simplify working with small Java programs: doing away with build files all together!

== Mill Single-File Scripts

Mill 1.1.0 supports a new xref:mill::javalib/intro.adoc#_single_file_scripts[single-file script]
format for Java, Scala, and Kotlin files. This lets you take the `HtmlScraper.java`
file above, add a `//|` build-header comment with the `mvnDeps` configuration it needs, and
xref:mill::javalib/script.adoc#_html_web_scraper[run it directly self-contained within a single file]:

.HtmlScraper.java
```java
//| mvnDeps:
//| - org.jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2
import org.jsoup.Jsoup;
import java.util.*;

public class HtmlScraper {
  static List<String> fetchLinks(String title) throws Exception {
    var url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" + title;
    var doc = Jsoup.connect(url).header("User-Agent", "My Scraper").get();
    var links = new ArrayList<String>();
    for (var a : doc.select("main p a")) {
      var href = a.attr("href");
      if (href.startsWith("/wiki/")) links.add(href.substring(6));
    }
    return links;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    if (args.length < 2) throw new Exception("HtmlScraper.java <start> <depth>");
    var seen = new HashSet<>(Set.of(args[0]));
    var current = new HashSet<>(Set.of(args[0]));
    for (int i = 0; i < Integer.parseInt(args[1]); i++) {
      var next = new HashSet<String>();
      for (String article : current) {
        for (String link : fetchLinks(article)) {
          if (seen.add(link)) next.add(link);
        }
      }
      current = next;
    }
    for (String s : seen) System.out.println(s);
  }
}
```

This can be run via

```console
> ./mill HtmlScraper.java Singapore 1
Hokkien
Conscription_in_Singapore
Malaysia_Agreement
Government_of_Singapore
...
```


Another neat example is xref:mill::javalib/script.adoc#_web_server[running a Spring-Boot
webserver, configured and implemented in a single file]:

.WebServer.java
```java
//| mvnDeps: [org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:3.2.0]
package example;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class WebServer {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    SpringApplication.run(WebServer.class, args);
    Thread.sleep(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
  }

  @PostMapping("/reverse-string")
  public String reverseString(@RequestBody String body) {
    return new StringBuilder(body).reverse().toString();
  }
}
```

```console
> ./mill WebServer.java:runBackground

> curl -d 'helloworld' localhost:8080/reverse-string
dlrowolleh
```

Although superficially Mill single-file scripts look like running a Python or Bash script, under
the hood it actually goes through the full build tool process - dependency resolution, compilation,
and execution - with every step cached and parallelized where-ever possible. While single-file
scripts are handy for cute demos like the one above, Mill fleshes them out enough that they are
a viable way of writing code on the JVM.

=== Rich Scripting on the JVM

Mill single-file scripts are inspired by the https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] project for Java,
https://ammonite.io/[Ammonite] and https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/[Scala-CLI] for Scala,
and https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2024/11/state-of-kotlin-scripting-2024/[Scripting for Kotlin],
which all give you the ability to write single-files scripts in JVM languages.
But Mill's single-file scripts are unique in how well they support the full set of build-tool
functionality and integrate with larger projects:

1. Mill scripts support the
{mill-doc-url}/api/latest/mill/javalib/JavaModule.html#mvnDeps-0[full range of configuration options]
available to any other Java module, where other JVM script runners tend to only support a subset

2. Mill scripts can have xref:mill::javalib/intro.adoc#_testing_scripts[test suites]
and xref:mill::javalib/script.adoc#_relative_and_absolute_script_moduledeps[depend on other scripts],
which other JVM script runners usually don't support

3. Mill scripts can be xref:mill::javalib/script.adoc#_packaging_assemblies_and_native_binaries[packaged into assemblies or native binaries]
for deployment

4. Mill scripts can integrate easily into larger projects via xref:mill::javalib/script.adoc#_custom_script_module_classes[custom script module classes] or
xref:mill::javalib/script.adoc#_project_moduledeps[project module deps], where other JVM script
runners tend to run standalone

5. Mill scripts have xref:mill::javalib/script.adoc#_script_ide_integration[full support in IDEs]
like IntelliJ or VSCode, where other JVM script runners often only have partial IDE support

image::ScriptIDESupport.png[]

Using Java to write small scripts isn't a new idea, with the ability to run `java Foo.java`
from the command line introduced in Java 11, and more feature-rich tools like JBang. But Mill
takes the idea several step further in polish and robustness, hopefully to a level where
scripting on the JVM can be a truly viable workflow rather than just a tech demo.

=== Multi-Language JVM Scripting

Like the rest of Mill, single-file scripts support the three major JVM languages, and you can
run scripts written in xref:mill::javalib/script.adoc[Java], xref:mill::scalalib/script.adoc[Scala],
or xref:mill::kotlinlib/script.adoc[Kotlin]. For example, here is a
xref:mill::kotlinlib/script.adoc#_html_web_scraper[Kotlin version of the HtmlScraper]

.HtmlScraper.kt
```kotlin
//| mvnDeps:
//| - org.jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2
import org.jsoup.Jsoup

fun fetchLinks(title: String): List<String> {
    val url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$title"
    val doc = Jsoup.connect(url).header("User-Agent", "My Scraper").get()

    return doc.select("main p a")
        .mapNotNull { a ->
            val href = a.attr("href")
            if (href.startsWith("/wiki/")) href.removePrefix("/wiki/")
            else null
        }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    if (args.size < 2) throw Exception("HtmlScraper.kt <start> <depth>")
    var seen = mutableSetOf(args[0])
    var current = mutableSetOf(args[0])

    repeat(args[1].toInt()) {
        val next = mutableSetOf<String>()
        for (article in current) {
            for (link in fetchLinks(article)) {
                if (seen.add(link)) next.add(link)
            }
        }
        current = next
    }
    seen.forEach { println(it) }
}
```
```console
> ./mill HtmlScraper.kt singapore 1
Hokkien
Conscription_in_Singapore
Malaysia_Agreement
Government_of_Singapore
...
```

And here is a xref:mill::scalalib/script.adoc#_html_web_scraper[Scala version of the HtmlScraper]:

.HtmlScraper.scala
```scala
//| mvnDeps:
//| - org.jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2
import org.jsoup.*
import scala.collection.JavaConverters.*

def fetchLinks(title: String): Seq[String] = {
  Jsoup.connect(s"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$title")
    .header("User-Agent", "My Scraper")
    .get().select("main p a").asScala.toSeq.map(_.attr("href"))
    .collect { case s"/wiki/$rest" => rest }
}

def main(startArticle: String, depth: Int) = {
  var seen = Set(startArticle)
  var current = Set(startArticle)
  for (i <- Range(0, depth)) {
    current = current.flatMap(fetchLinks(_)).filter(!seen.contains(_))
    seen = seen ++ current
  }

  pprint.log(seen, height = Int.MaxValue)
}
```
```console
> ./mill HtmlScraper.scala --start-article singapore --depth 1
  "Hokkien",
  "Conscription_in_Singapore",
  "Malaysia_Agreement",
  "Government_of_Singapore",
...
```

Java is not the only JVM language, and languages like Kotlin or Scala complement it well by
offering a more concise experience that may be more suitable for scripts. So even if scripting
in Java may not suit you, scripting in Kotlin or Scala are definitely options you can consider
while still benefiting from the robust runtime and rich ecosystem of the JVM.

== Conclusion

While developers may differ in what their preferred JVM language is, we think that all three
major JVM languages are criminally under-utilized when it comes to writing scripts and small
programs. Java, Scala, and Kotlin are all great languages, with high-quality standard libraries,
rich ecosystems of third-party libraries, and a rock-solid JVM runtime. However, due to tooling
complexity, JVM languages have never been the preferred choice for small programs the same way
they are often used for large-scale enterprise systems.

With the new declarative and single-file configuration styles in Mill 1.1.0, we hope to be
able to change that. Mill's new declarative `build.mill.yaml` files
take the best ideas from Maven, while streamlining installation, syntax, and command-line
usage. Mill's single-file scripts take that a step further allowing any `.java`, `.scala`, or
`.kt` file to be annotated and run without needing to set up a separate "project"
or "build file".

Lastly, rather than having to juggle a zoo of different tools for different purposes -
https://www.jenv.be/[JEnv], https://sdkman.io/[SdkMan], https://maven.apache.org/[Maven],
https://gradle.org/[Gradle], https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] - Mill provides everything you
need in one xref:16-zero-setup.adoc[zero-setup bootstrap script]. This makes it trivial to
for anyone using any JVM language to run your code conveniently and consistently.

If you have made it this far, we hope that some of the problems and challenges we have discussed
in this article resonate with your own personal experience. If you are interested in trying out
Mill's new declarative configuration syntax or single-file scripts, please check out the
