This article will explore use of JVM languages as scripting languages, replacing the Bash and
Python scripts common throughout the industry. We will walk through examples of how the JVM's
benefits of performance, compile-time safety, and vast library ecosystem are advantages over
traditional script platforms, but also how language verbosity, build tool overhead, and lack
of convenient libraries hampers the effort. Lastly we will demonstrate how script-focused
tooling is able to smooth over some of those issues, simplifying build configuration and
providing suitable libraries to make the JVM truly a world-class scripting environment as robust
as any scripting language out there.
