Assembly jars are a convenient deployment format for JVM applications, bundling
your application code and resources into a single file that can run anywhere a JVM
is installed. But assembly jars can be slow to create, which can slow down iterative
development workflows that depend on them. The Mill JVM build tool uses some special
tricks to let you iterate on your assembly jars much faster than traditional build tools
like Maven or Gradle, which can substantially increase your developer productivity.
