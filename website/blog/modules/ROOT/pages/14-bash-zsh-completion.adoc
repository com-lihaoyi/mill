Bash and Zsh tab-completion can be very handy for anyone trying to use an unfamiliar
API. The latest version 1.0.3 of the {mill-doc-url}[Mill build tool] has Bash and Zsh
tab-completion that shows a description of each command or flag being completed:

It also shows the description of a command or flag when you press `<tab>` after
the token is complete:

Completion descriptions take some configuring in Zsh, are not normally available in
the Bash shell, and neither shell shows any completion when you press `<tab>` after
a token is already complete. But with some work this can be implemented regardless.
This blog post discusses how it is done in Mill, and how you can do it yourself for
your own command-line completion scripts
