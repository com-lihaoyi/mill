= Configuring JVM Versions

By default, Mill uses the same JVM that it itself is running on to compile/test/run
Java/Scala/Kotlin modules, typically whatever `java` command you have available globally
or what you have configured in your xref:cli/build-header.adoc[]. This page goes into
more detail about downloading and using a custom Java home on a per-module basis.


Note that when publishing artifacts to Maven repositories, the JVM version used to build the
artifacts will be the minimum version that downstream projects will need to use in order to
use your artifacts.

* For libraries is best to set your `mill-jvm-version` to the lowest version possible, e.g.
  `mill-jvm-version: 11` in this example which is the lowest version supported by Mill.
* For applications without downstream projects, using the highest available JVM version is
  usually preferred to let your application take advantage of the latest JVM improvements
