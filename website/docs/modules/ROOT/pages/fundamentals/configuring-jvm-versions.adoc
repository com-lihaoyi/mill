= Configuring JVM Versions

By default, Mill uses the same JVM that it itself is running on to compile/test/run
Java/Scala/Kotlin modules, typically whatever `java` command you have available globally
or what you have configured in your xref:cli/build-header.adoc[]. This page goes into
more detail about downloading and using a custom Java home on a per-module basis.
