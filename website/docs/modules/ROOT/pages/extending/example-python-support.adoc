= Example: Python Support



This section demonstrates how to integrate `Python` support into `Mill`.
We will define a simple `PythonModule` trait that can resolve dependencies,
perform type checking on local code, and bundle an executable.
 
NOTE: This integration is for educational purposes only, showcasing common technique
used in building language toolchains, and is not intended for production use.

== Basic Python Build Pipeline

== Re-usable PythonModule

include::partial$example/extending/python/2-python-modules.adoc[]

== PythonModule `moduleDeps`

include::partial$example/extending/python/3-python-module-deps.adoc[]

== PIP dependencies and bundling

include::partial$example/extending/python/4-python-libs-bundle.adoc[]



As mentioned, The `PythonModule` examples here demonstrate 
how to add support for a new language toolchain in Mill.
A production-ready version would require more work to enhance features and performance.
