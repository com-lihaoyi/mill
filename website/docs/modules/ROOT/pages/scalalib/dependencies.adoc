== Scala Dependencies In Detail

Scala major releases up until version `2.13` are binary incompatible.
That means, mixing dependencies of different binary platforms will result in non-working runtimes and obscure and hard to debug issues.

To easily pick only a compatible version, a convention was established to append the scala major version as a suffix to the package name.footnote:[
Scala 2 versions have the unusual version format: `{epoch}.{major}.{minor}`.]
E.g. to select the Scala 2.13 version of a library `foo`, the final `artifactId` will contain the additional suffix `_2.13`, such that the final `artifactId` is `foo_2.13`.

To always pick the right version and support cross compiling,
you can omit the scala version and instead use a double colon (`::`) between the `organization` and the `name`, e.g. `ivy"com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor_2.12:2.5.25"`.
Your module needs to `extends ScalaModule` though.

If you want to use dependencies that are cross-published against the full Scala version, e.g. `2.12.12`,
you can use three colons (`:::`) between `organization` and `name`, e.g.: `ivy"org.scalamacros:::paradise:2.1.1"`.

.Example
[source,scala]
----
def ivyDeps = Seq(
  // explicit scala version suffix, NOT RECOMMENDED!
  ivy"com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor_2.12:2.5.25",
  ivy"com.typesafe.akka::akka-actor:2.5.25",
  ivy"org.scalamacros:::paradise:2.1.1"
)

=== Scala 3 interoperability

Since the release of Scala 3, the binary compatibility story for Scala has changed.
That means, Scala 3 dependencies can be mixed with Scala 2.13 dependencies.
In fact, the Scala 3 standard library is the same as for Scala 2.13.


[CAUTION]
--
As Scala 3 and Scala 2.13 have different binary platforms, but their artifacts are in general compatible, this introduces new challenges.

There is currently no mechanism to bring the same dependency twice into the classpath (one for Scala 2.13 and one for Scala 3).

=== Using Scala 2.13 from Scala 3

If your Scala version is a Scala 3.x, but you want to use the Scala 2.13 version of a specific library, you can use the `.withDottyCompat` method on that dependency.

.Example:
[source,scala]
----
def scalaVersion = "3.2.1"
def ivyDeps = Seq(
  ivy"com.lihaoyi::upickle:2.0.0".withDottyCompat(scalaVersion()) //1
)
----
<1> This will result in a Scala 2.13 dependency `com.lihaoyi::upicke_2.13:2.0.0`


[NOTE]
--
Do you wonder where the name "dotty" comes from?

In the early development of Scala 3, the Scala 3 compiler was called "Dotty". Later, the name was changed to Scala 3, but the compiler project itself is still named "dotty".

The dotty compiler itself is an implementation of the http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/dot/fool.pdf[Dependent Object Types (DOT) calculus], which is the new basis of Scala 3. It also enhances the type system to a next level and allows features like union-types and intersection-types.

=== ScalaJS dependencies

Scala.js introduces an additional binary platform axis.
To the already required Scala version, there comes the Scala.js version.

You can use two colons (`::`) between `name` and `version` to define a Scala.js dependency.
Your module needs to `extends ScalaJSModule` to accept Scala.js dependencies.

=== Scala Native dependencies

Scala Native introduces an additional binary platform axis.
To the already required Scala version, there comes the Scala Native version.

You can use two colons (`::`) between `name` and `version` to define a Scala Native dependency.
Your module needs to `extends ScalaNativeModule` to accept Scala Native dependencies.
