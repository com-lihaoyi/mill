= Simple Scala Modules
:language: Scala
:language-small: scala

This page documents the usage of simple config-based Scala modules defined by a
`mill.yaml` file. These are less flexible but easier to get started with than the
full `build.mill` or `package.mill` build files, which makes them ideal for small
projects which do not need additional flexibility.
