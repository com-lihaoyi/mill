= Simple Java Modules
:language: Java
:language-small: java

This page documents the usage of simple config-based Java modules defined by
`build.mill.yaml` and `package.mill.yaml` files. These are less flexible but easier to get started with than the
full `build.mill` or `package.mill` build files, which makes them ideal for small
projects which do not need additional flexibility.
