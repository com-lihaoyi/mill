== Checking API compatibility

Mill provides the ability to check API changes with the https://revapi.org/revapi-site/main/index.html[Revapi] analysis and change tracking tool.

include::partial$example/javalib/publishing/3-revapi.adoc[]

CAUTION: The `revapi` task does not fail if incompatibilities are reported. You should fix these, and verify by re-running `revapi`, before a release.

[TIP]
====
The `revapi` task returns the path to a directory that can be used to resolve the relative path to any extension configuration output.
