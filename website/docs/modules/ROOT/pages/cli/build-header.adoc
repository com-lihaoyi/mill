= Build Header Config

Mill supports a YAML comment block at the top of the `build.mill` file to configure
your project. This must be at the very top of the `build.mill` file in YAML 1.2
syntax, with every line prepended with ``//| ``, with YAML comments and newlines
allowed. This contains Mill configuration that needs to take effect before the
body of the `build.mill` file has been compiled and loaded.

For example, a build header may look something like:

[source,scala]
----
//| mill-version: {mill-version}
//| # yaml comments are allowed in the build header
//| mill-opts: ["--jobs=0.5C"]
//| mill-jvm-version: temurin:11
//| mill-jvm-opts: ["-XX:NonProfiledCodeHeapSize=250m", "-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=500m"]
//| mill-scala-version: 3.7.2-RC1
//| # newlines are allowed too
//|
//| repositories:
//| - https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots
//| mvnDeps:
//| - com.goyeau::mill-scalafix::0.5.1-14-4d3f5ea-SNAPSHOT

...rest of the build.mill file...
----

Mill's build headers can contain the following keys:

1. xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc[mill-version]: this must be unquoted in the first line
   of the build header, and specifies the version of Mill used in this project.

2. xref:#_mill_opts[]: flags to pass to Mill by default, useful for flags that you want
   everyone to use so they don't need to always remember to type them at the command line

3. xref:_mill_jvm_version[]: specifies an explicit JVM version to use, useful to help
   keep the build reproducible even when run on different machines.

4. xref:_mill_jvm_opts[]: flags to pass to Mill's background daemon JVM process,
   e.g. to configure how much memory to give it

4. `mvnDeps` and `repositories`: these allow you to define dependencies for usage
   in your `build.mill`, and are described in more detail in the
   xref:extending/import-mvn-plugins.adoc[Import Libraries and Plugins] page
   Other keys are allowed as well, and these are uniformly treated as overrides for
   tasks on xref:extending/meta-build.adoc[]

`mill-version`, `mill-opts`, `mill-jvm-version`, and `mill-jvm-opts` can also be
provided as standalone files on disk (e.g. `.mill-version`) for compatibility with
older versions of Mill, or the `.config` folder (e.g. `.config/mill-version`)
following the https://dot-config.github.io/[`.config` XDG Base Directory Standard]

== mill-opts

Mill supports `mill-opts` for passing a default set of command line
options to Mill itself.For example, if your project's tasks are CPU heavy, you
may want everyone using your project to run only 0.5 concurrent tasks per CPU. This
can be done by adding your build header:

_build.mill_

[source]
----
//| mill-opts: ["--jobs=0.5C"]
----

The file name `.mill-opts` can be overridden via the `MILL_OPTS_PATH` environment variable.
You can also pass in flags like `--jobs=10` explicitly to override the value passed in
`.mill-opts`.

NOTE: `.mill-jvm-opts` is for passing JVM options to the JVM running Mill,
and `.mill-opts` is for passing options to Mill itself.If you want to pass JVM options
to the project that Mill is building and running, see the section on
xref:javalib/module-config.adoc#_compilation_execution_flags[Compilation and Execution Flags].


== mill-jvm-version

Mill allows you to specify the exact JVM version you want to use to run the build tool
via a `mill-jvm-version` key in the build header, which also becomes the default
version used for any JVMs spawned by Mill to `run` or `test` your project:

_build.mill_

[source]
----
//| mill-jvm-version: temurin:17.0.6
----

An explicit `mill-jvm-version` can help ensure your project uses a consistent JVM version and
behaves identically regardless of what the developer may have installed on their laptop
or dev environment. If `mill-jvm-version` is not provided, Mill uses the globally-installed
`java` installation if there is one present on your `PATH`, and otherwise will download and
cache a default version of Java for usage.


== mill-jvm-opts

Mill supports `mill-jvm-opts` to set JVM-level flags
It's possible to pass JVM options to the Mill launcher.To do this you can either set
the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable, xref:cli/build-header.adoc[], or create a `.mill-jvm-opts` file in your project's
root that contains JVM options one per line.

For example, if your build requires a lot of memory and bigger stack size, you could run

[source,console]
----
> JAVA_OPTS='-Xss10m -Xmx10G' ./mill __.compile
----

Build header metadata:

_build.mill_
[source]
----
//| mill-jvm-opts: ["-Xss10m", "-Xmx10G"]
----

`mill-jvm-opts` also supports environment variable interpolation, e.g.

[source]
----
-Dmy.jvm.property=${PWD}
----

Missing environment variables are converted to the empty string.

== mill-scala-version

Mill allows you to specify the Scala version you want to use for your build
via a `mill-scala-version` key in the build header:

_build.mill_

[source]
----
//| mill-scala-version: 3.7.2-RC1
----

This allows you to use newer versions of Scala than the version used by Mill
itself, as long as the version you use is backwards compatible.

If `mill-scala-version` is not provided, Mill uses the version of Scala
used by Mill itself.
