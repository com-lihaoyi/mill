= Installation & IDE Setup

The standard method of installing Mill is to install a `./mill` <<_bootstrap_scripts,bootstrap script>>,
similar to `./gradlew` or `./mvnw` in other build tools.
This script can determine the best version to be used by a project (e.g. by
reading a `.mill-version`) and will use this exact Mill version.
If the determined Mill version is not installed locally, it will be downloaded automatically.

For all the examples in this documentation, there is a `download` link that provides
a zip file containing the full example ready to use. These examples come with a `./mill`
script you can use to immediately begin working with the project, needing only a JVM installed
globally.

[#_bootstrap_scripts]
== Bootstrap Scripts

The Mill example projects in this documentation come with `./mill` and `./mill.bat`
bootstrap script, included. You can also download the boostrap script manually:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
# Mac/Linux
curl -L {mill-download-url}/mill -o mill
chmod +x mill
echo {mill-version} > .mill-version

# Windows
curl -L {mill-download-url}/mill.bat -o mill.bat
echo {mill-version} > .mill-version
----

[CAUTION]
--
*Don't use PowerShell 5.1 to install Mill!*
 +
PowerShell 5.1 is known to produce `UTF-16LE` encoded `.mill-version` files, which can't be read by Mill.
You should update to Powershell 7 or newer.
--

Downloading a `mill` bootstrap script to the root of your project repository helps make it easier for
new contributors to build your project, as they don't have to install Mill before they can start.
Anyone who wants to work with the project can simply use the `./mill` script directly.

[source,bash]
----
./mill --version
./mill __.compile # double underscore
----


In general, bootstrap scripts are the recommended way of installing Mill.
Similar to `./gradlew` or `./mvnw`, the `./mill` bootstrap script
reduces the chance of errors due to the installed version of Mill
being incompatible with the version expected by your build.
In-project bootstrap scripts are also useful for running Mill in CI/CD, ensuring
that your build server like Jenkins or Github Actions has the correct version of Mill
present to build, compile or test your code.

If you are starting a new project using a Mill bootstrap script, you can use the
xref:cli/builtin-commands.adoc#_init[mill init] to initialize the project
folder with one of the Mill example projects. There are a wide range of example projects,
from hello-world to multi-module libraries to client-server web applications, and you can
pick one most similar to what you are doing so you can hit the ground running working.

=== Mill Native Executable

The default Mill executable configured above requires a JVM (11 or above) installed globally in
order to run, and imposes some Java startup overhead (100-200ms) when running Mill from the
command line. You can also use Mill's native executables by appending a `-native` suffix to the
Mill version:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
echo {version}-native > .mill-version
----

Using the `-native` suffix should provide a faster CLI experience than using Mill's default
JVM launcher, and makes it easier to install Mill in environments without a JVM pre-installed.


Mill native executables are supported on the following OS/CPU combinations:

|===
| | Windows | Mac | Linux
| Intel | Y | Y | Y
| ARM |  | Y | Y
|===

Notably, Mill native executables _do not_ support Windows-ARM, due to limitations in the
upstream Graal Native Image tooling (see https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/9215[oracle/graal#9215]).
If you are on a platform not supported by Mill's native executables, use the default
JVM launcher instead.

=== Customizing Mill's JVM

Mill allows you to specify the exact JVM version you want to use to run the build tool
via a  `.mill-jvm-version` file such as:

[source,bash]
----
echo temurin:17.0.6 > .mill-jvm-version
----

This has two benefits

* `.mill-jvm-version` can also be used with Mill's default JVM launcher if you want
your Mill process to use a different JVM than what you have installed globally. This
can help ensure your project uses a consistent JVM version and behaves identically regardless
of what the developer may have installed on their laptop or dev environment

* `.mill-jvm-version` can be used together with <<Mill Native Executable>>s to build your
project without needing a JVM pre-installed at all. This simplifies project setup and
onboarding of new developers.


== IDE Support
:link-metals: https://scalameta.org/metals/

Mill supports IntelliJ and VSCode and in general any client of the standard
https://build-server-protocol.github.io/[Build Server Protocol (BSP)].



Your IDEs may already auto-detect the Mill project and run this command on behalf of you, when opening/importing the project.

=== IntelliJ

To use Mill with IntelliJ, first ensure you have the free
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-scala[IntelliJ Scala Plugin]
installed. This is necessary as Mill build files are written in Scala,
even if you are using it to build a Java or Kotlin or Python project.

Once you have the plugin installed, you can use IntelliJ to open any project
containing a Mill `build.mill` file, and IntelliJ will automatically load the
Mill build. If you have multiple build systems installed, Intellij may give you
choice which build system configuration to use for the import, which case select `BSP`:

image::basic/IntellijSelectBsp.png[]



This will provide support both for your application code,
as well as the code in the `build.mill`:

image::basic/IntellijApp.png[]

image::basic/IntellijBuild.png[]

If IntelliJ does not highlight the `.mill` files correctly, you can explicitly enable
it by adding `*.mill` to the `Scala` file type:

image::basic/IntellijFileTypeConfig.png[]

If you make changes to your Mill `build.mill`, you can ask Intellij to load
those updates by opening the "BSP" tab and clicking the "Refresh" button

image::basic/IntellijRefresh.png[]

To prepare your project for IDEs, and in general any BSP client, you can also
run this command to generate the BSP configuration files:

[source,bash]
----
./mill mill.bsp.BSP/install
----

==== IntelliJ IDEA XML Support

Apart from using the Build Server Protocol, you can also generate IDEA project
files directly with Mill. This is probably the preferred way if you work on
polyglot projects and need support for frameworks like AspectJ,
which are currently not specifically configured over BSP.

To generate IntelliJ IDEA project files into `.idea/`, run:

[source,bash]
----
./mill mill.idea.GenIdea/
----

This will generate the XML files IntelliJ uses to configure your project

[source]
----
.idea
.idea/scala_settings.xml
.idea/mill_modules
.idea/mill_modules/.iml
.idea/mill_modules/mill-build.iml
.idea/mill_modules/test.iml
.idea/libraries
.idea/libraries/mill_scalalib_2_13_0_11_10_jar.xml
...
.idea/workspace.xml
.idea/modules.xml
.idea/scala_compiler.xml
.idea/misc.xml
----

After the files are generated, you can open the folder in IntelliJ to load the project
into your IDE. If you make changes to your Mill `build.mill`, you can update the project config
those updates by running `./mill mill.idea.GenIdea/` again.

=== VSCode

To use Mill with VSCode, first ensure you have the free
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals[Metals VSCode Scala language server]
installed. This is necessary as Mill build files are written in Scala,
even if you are using it to build a Java project.

NOTE: Mill in VSCode only supports Java and Scala. Kotlin users are advised to use the free  IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition

Once you have the language server installed, you can ask VSCode to open any folder
containing a Mill `build.mill` file, and VSCode will ask you to import your
Mill build. This will provide support both for your application code,
as well as the code in the `build.mill`:

image::basic/VSCodeApp.png[]

image::basic/VSCodeBuild.png[]

If you make changes to your Mill `build.mill`, you can ask VSCode to load
those updates by opening the "BSP" tab and clicking the "Refresh" button

image::basic/VSCodeRefresh.png[]

=== Other Editors / Metals

A lot of other editors may work too, since {link-metals}[Metals], the Language Server for Scala has built-in support for BSP. See the <<_ide_support,general instructions>> above.

=== Debugging IDE issues

Mill's BSP IDE integration writes to a log file under
`.bsp/mill-bsp.stderr`, where you can find various information about what's
going on. It contains regular Mill output accompanied by additional BSP
client-server communication details. This can be useful to look at if your
IDE fails to import your Mill project

== Updating Mill

Typically, most Mill projects use a `.mill-version` file to configure what version
to use. You can update the version specified in this file in order to change the version
of Mill. The file path `.config/mill-version` is also supported. If neither is provided,
the `./mill` bootstrap script will use the `DEFAULT_MILL_VERSION` it has built in.

To choose a different Mill version on an ad-hoc basis, e.g. for experimentation, you can pass
in a `MILL_VERSION` environment variable, e.g.

[source,bash]
----
MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb mill __.compile
----

or

[source,bash]
----
MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb ./mill __.compile
----

to override the Mill version manually. This takes precedence over the version
specified in `./mill`, `.config/mill-version` or `.mill-version`

== Using Mill without access to Maven Central

Under some circumstances (e.g. corporate firewalls), you may not have access maven central.
The typical symptom will be error messages which look like this;

[source]
----
1 tasks failed
mill.scalalib.JvmWorkerModule.classpath
Resolution failed for 1 modules:
--------------------------------------------
  com.lihaoyi:mill-scalalib-worker_2.13:0.11.1
        not found: C:\Users\partens\.ivy2\local\com.lihaoyi\mill-scalalib-worker_2.13\0.11.1\ivys\ivy.xml
        download error: Caught java.io.IOException (Server returned HTTP response code: 503 for URL: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/lihaoyi/mill-scalalib-worker_2.13/0.11.1/mill-scalalib-worker_2.13-0.11.1.pom) while downloading https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/lihaoyi/mill-scalalib-worker_2.13/0.11.1/mill-scalalib-worker_2.13-0.11.1.pom
----

It is expected that basic commands (e.g. clean) will not work, as Mill saying it is
unable to resolve it's own, fundamental, dependencies from the default Maven Central
JVM package repository. Under such circumstances, you
will normally have access to some proxy, or other corporate repository which resolves
maven artifacts. The strategy is simply to tell mill to use that instead.

To resolve this, you can set an environment variable COURSIER_REPOSITORIES (see coursier docs)
to point at your own server that mirrors the Maven Central artifacts.
The below command should pass the environment variable to the `mill` command.

[source]
----
COURSIER_REPOSITORIES=https://packages.corp.com/artifactory/maven/ mill resolve _
----

If you are using bootstrap script, a more permanent solution could be to set the environment variable
at the top of the bootstrap script, or as a user environment variable.



== Automatic Mill updates

If your project is hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you can use
https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward[Scala Steward] to
automatically open a pull request to update your Mill version (in
`.mill-version` or `.config/mill-version` file), whenever there is a newer version available.

TIP: Scala Steward can also
xref:scalalib/dependencies.adoc#_keeping_up_to_date_with_scala_steward[scan your project dependencies]
and keep them up-to-date.

== Unstable Development Releases

In case you want to try out the latest features and improvements that are
currently in the main branch, unstable versions of Mill
are available as versions named:

* `+{stable-version}-{commits-since-stable-version}-{commit-hash}+`

For example, `0.12.5-193-b4d975` is an unstable release after `0.12.5`, with `193`
additional commits, on commit hash `b4d975`.

The list of unstable releases can be seen on Maven Central:

* https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/lihaoyi/mill-dist

Or find the latest unstable version here:

* https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.lihaoyi/mill-dist

You can update your `.mill-version` to to the unstable version and the bootstrap script
will download it for you to try it out in your project.



== Other installation methods

CAUTION: The installation methods listed below are maintained outside of Mill and may not have
the same features as the xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_bootstrap_scripts[bootstrap scripts]. You can try using them,
but the officially supported way to use Mill is via the bootstrap script above, so the Mill
maintainers may be unable to help you if you have issues with some alternate installation method.

CAUTION: Some of the installations via package managers install a fixed version of Mill and
do not support project-specific selection of the preferred Mill version. If you want to use
the `MILL_VERSION` environment variable or need support for `.mill-version` or
`.config/mill-version` files to control the actual used Mill version, please use
a xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_bootstrap_scripts[bootstrap script] instead.
