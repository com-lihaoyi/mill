= Parallelism in Mill

By default, Mill will evaluate all tasks in parallel, with the number of concurrent
tasks equal to the number of cores on your machine. You can use the
xref:cli/flags.adoc#_jobs_j[--jobs]
to configure explicitly how many concurrent tasks you wish to run, or `-j1` to disable
parallelism and run on a single core.

== When Can Tasks Be Parallelized?

The actual amount of parallelism may depend on the structure of the build in question:

- Tasks and modules that depend on each other have to run sequentially
- Tasks and modules that are independent can run in parallel

In general, Mill is able to provide the most parallelism for "wide" builds
with a lot of independent modules in a shallow hierarchy.

If you want to visualize the structure of your build graph, you can use
xref:cli/builtin-commands.adoc#_visualize[./mill visualize] on the tasks you
care about. e.g. if you want to visualize the relationship between the various
`.compile` tasks:

[source,console]
----
$ ./mill visualize __.compile
----

image::basic/VisualizeCompiles.svg[VisualizeCompiles.svg]

`visualize` renders an SVG which lets you see how the various tasks you selected depend
(or not depend) on one another. This can be very helpful to figure out where the
bottlenecks in your build are, and from there come up with ideas of refactoring your
build to improve parallelism.



== Mill Chrome Profiles

Every `mill` run generates an output file in `out/mill-chrome-profile.json` that can be
loaded into the Chrome browser's `chrome://tracing` page for visualization. This can make
it much easier to analyze your parallel runs to find out what's taking the most time:

The chrome profile is great for finding bottlenecks in your parallel builds, since you
can usually see if there's a task taking a long time before downstream tasks can begin.
These "long poll" tasks are usually good targets for optimization: e.g. a long `compile`
task may be improved by breaking down its module into smaller modules that can `compile`
independently and in parallel.

== Consequences of Parallelism in Mill

Mill running tasks in parallel means that you have to take care that your
code is _thread safe_. Your build will have multiple tasks running in parallel,
and if your tasks are using shared mutable state then there is risk of race
conditions and non-deterministic bugs. This is usually not a problem for
most Mill code following the standard conventions, but it is worth taking note of:

* For code written in a typical Scala style, which focuses on immutable values and
  pure functions, the code is typically thread safe by default. "Local" mutability
  e.g. within a function does not cause issues either

* For tasks writing to the filesystem, make sure you only write to `Task.dest`, which
  is a dedicated folder assigned to each task. This ensures that you do not have multiple
  tasks writing to the same files in parallel, allowing these filesystem writes to
  be safe and race-free even in the presence of parallelism

* For long-lived in-memory xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc#_workers[Workers], the value is
  __initialized__ in a single-thread, but may be __used__ from multiple threads concurrently.
  The onus is on the implementer to ensure that the worker values are safe to be used
  concurrently from multiple tasks: whether by wrapping mutating operations in
  `synchronized` blocks, using concurrent data structures like ``ConcurrentHashMap``s,
  or Mill helpers like xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc#_cachedfactory_workers[CachedFactory].
