= The Mill Process Architecture



This page goes into detail of how the Mill process and application is structured.
At a high-level, a simplified version of the main components and data-flows within
a running Mill process is shown below:

== The Mill Client

The Mill launcher is a small Java application that is responsible for launching
and delegating work to the Mill daemon, a long-lived process. Each `./mill`
command spawns a new Mill launcher, but generally re-uses the same Mill daemon where
possible in order to reduce startup overhead and to allow the Mill daemon
process to warm up and provide good performance

* The Mill launcher takes all the inputs of a typical command-line application -
stdin and command-line arguments - and proxies them to the long-lived Mill
daemon process.

* It then takes the outputs from the Mill daemon - stdout, stderr,
and finally the exitcode - and proxies those back to the calling process or terminal.

In this way, the Mill launcher acts and behaves for most all intents and purposes
as a normal CLI application, except it is really a thin wrapper around logic that
is actually running in the long-lived Mill daemon.

The Mill daemon sometimes is shut down and needs to be restarted, e.g. if Mill
version changed, or the user used `Ctrl-C` to interrupt the ongoing computation.
In such a scenario, the Mill launcher will automatically restart the daemon the next
time it is run, so apart from a slight performance penalty from starting a "cold"
Mill daemon such shutdowns and restarts should be mostly invisibl to the user.

== The Mill Daemon

The Mill daemon is a long-lived process that the Mill launcher spawns.
Only one Mill daemon should be running in a codebase at a time, and each daemon
takes a filelock at startup time to enforce this mutual exclusion.

The Mill daemon compiles your `build.mill` and `package.mill`, spawns a
`URLClassLoader` containing the compiled classfiles, and uses that to instantiate
the variousxref:fundamentals/modules.adoc[] and xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc[]
dynamically in-memory. These are then used by the `Evaluator`, which resolves,
plans, and executes the tasks specified by the given `runArgs`

During execution, both standard output
and standard error are captured during evaluation and forwarded to the `PromptLogger`.
`PromptLogger` annotates the output stream with the line-prefixes, prompt, and ANSI
terminal commands necessary to generate the dynamic prompt, and then forwards both
streams multi-plexed over a single socket stream back to the Mill launcher. The launcher
then de-multiplexes the combined stream to split it back into output and error, which
are then both forwarded to the process or terminal that invoked the Mill launcher.

Lastly, when the Mill daemon completes its tasks, it writes the `exitCode` to a file
that is then propagated back to the Mill launcher. The Mill launcher terminates with this
exit code, but the Mill daemon remains alive and ready to serve to the next Mill
launcher that connects to it

For a more detailed discussion of what exactly goes into "execution", see
xref:depth/evaluation-model.adoc[].


== The Out Folder

The `out/` directory is where most of Mill's state lives on disk, both build-task state
such as the `foo/compile.json` metadata cache for `foo.compile`, or the `foo/compile.dest`
which stores any generated files or binaries. It also contains `mill-daemon/` folder which
is used to pass data back and forth between the launcher and daemon: the `runArgs`, `exitCode`,
etc.

Each task during evaluation reads and writes from its own designated paths in the `out/`
folder. Each task's files are not touched by any other tasks, nor are they used in the rest
of the Mill architecture: they are solely meant to serve each task's caching and filesystem
needs.

More documentation on what the `out/` directory contains and how to make use of it can be
found at xref:fundamentals/out-dir.adoc[].
