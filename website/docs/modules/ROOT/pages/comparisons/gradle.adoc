= Comparing Mill vs Gradle: Programmable Builds

Gradle is a popular open source build tool in the Java and JVM ecosystem, second only
to Maven. Gradle's core API is built around programmable configuration files written in
Groovy or Kotlin: this provides a lot of flexibility, but also a lot of complexity,
sparking complaints about
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25801986[Gradle being complicated and hard to maintain].

Mill defaults to a declarative
xref:javalib/intro.adoc#_config_based_modules[config-based module syntax], but when you do need
to extend your build with custom logic Mill's
xref:javalib/intro.adoc#_programmable_modules[programmable module syntax]
allows you to do so. Unlike Gradle, Mill builds upon the
idea of xref:#_object_oriented_builds[object-oriented builds] which provides a much more familiar
programming API with much better IDE support than Gradle or other build tools have been able to do.

This article will discuss some of the problems with Gradle, and how Mill is able to improve upon
the Gradle's design to provide programmatic builds without the complexity or confusion.

== Extending Gradle

Most real projects require some kind of ad-hoc build customizations: you may be pre-processing static
assets for web deployment, embedding build metadata for runtime debugging, or generating
reports for security scanning. For example, consider the following requirement:

> Count the lines of code in this project and include this as a resource for use at runtime
> as a `line-count.txt` file

This is a bit of an artificial requirement, but it is representative of the many things that
real projects need to do in their build. Doing this in Gradle looks something like this:

[,kotlin]
----
import java.io.File

tasks.register("generateLineCount") {
    val sourceDirs = listOf("src/main/java")
    val outputDir = layout.buildDirectory.dir("generated-resources")
    val outputFile = outputDir.get().file("line-count.txt")

    inputs.files(fileTree("src/main"))
    outputs.file(outputFile)

    doLast {
        var totalLines = 0

        sourceDirs.map(::file).filter { it.exists() }.forEach { srcDir ->
            srcDir.walkTopDown()
                .filter { it.isFile && it.extension in listOf("java") }
                .forEach { file ->
                    totalLines += file.readLines().size
                }
        }

        outputFile.asFile.writeText(totalLines.toString())
        println("Generated line-count.txt with $totalLines lines")
    }
}

tasks.named("processResources") {
    dependsOn("generateLineCount")
    from(layout.buildDirectory.dir("generated-resources"))
}
----

=== Gradle Build Plugin APIs

This is a very basic build customization, but you may already notice some issues.
Firstly, the Gradle "config as code" may be using Kotlin, doesn't _actually_
look like Kotlin code you are writing day-to-day. In particular, there's a non-trivial
"build plugin API" you need to learn to write this:

- `task.named` & `task.register`
- `dependsOn`
- `inputs.files` & `outputs.file`
- `doLast` (or should we use `doFirst`?)

Furthermore, the stringly-typed values add to the potential for error:

- `"generateLineCount"`
- `"generated-resources"`
- `"processResources"`
- `"src/main/java"`
- `"src/main"`


In fact, there is even a bug in the above Gradle config that will cause the build to
be non-deterministically slower sometimes, but not other times.
Can you spot it? ChatGPT couldn't! (Click the footnote to see the answer footnote:[The bug is `inputs.files` is depending on `src/main`, when it only really needs
`src/main/java`. That means that changes to `src/main/resources` or `src/main/templates`
will cause the task redundantly re-compute, making your build slower than necessary. If the bug was the other way -
rather than depending on too large a folder instead depending on too small a folder -
it would instead cause flakiness where `generateLineCount` would sometimes not run when it needs to.])

The difficulty of catching these issues e.g. during code review
illustrates how difficult it is to write "correct" Gradle config: if even the simplest
hello-world customization results in impossible-to-find bugs slowing things down, how many
bugs will there be in any more-complex real-world customization or plugin? It's no wonder
then than real-world builds using Gradle or other tools often end up being inexplicably
slow and flaky!


The end result is that although you may know Kotlin as a compiled language,
you will likely be unfamiliar with Gradle's flavor of Kotlin. Counting the lines
of code in a folder is something any Kotlin programmer can do, but properly wiring
it into a Gradle build can be a tricky affair that requires some strategic Googling.
Lastly, although the JVM platform is famous for having excellent IDE support, when
working with Gradle your IDE will likely not be as useful as you would like. We'll
dive into what that means in the next section.


=== Gradle IDE Support


While JVM application codebases universally have excellent IDE support, build tools are usually
not nearly as well-supported. For example, consider the snippet below where we are using Gradle to
configure the javac compiler options. The autocomplete and code-assist experience working
with these files is hit-or-miss. In the example below, we can see that IntelliJ is able to
identify that `compileArgs` exists and has the type `List<String>`:

image:comparisons/IntellijMockitoGradleCompileOptions.png[]

But if you try to jump to definition or find out anything else about it you hit a wall.
The IDE is able to bring you to the getter and setter, but it isn't able to tell you
_where the value is coming from_, _how it is computed_, or _where it is used_:

image:comparisons/IntellijMockitoGradleCompileOptions2.png[]

Often working with build configurations feels like constantly hitting a wall: if you
don't have `options.compilerArgs` memorized in your head, there is literally nothing
you can do in your IDE to figure out what it is or what it is used for. That leaves
you Googling for answers or digging through stackoverflow, which can be a frustrating
experience. Even modern AI assistants like ChatGPT or Gemini often hallucinate and get
things wrong.

Although this example is using Gradle's un-typed Groovy syntax, the experience
using Gradle's typed Kotlin syntax is largely the same. The problem isn't unique
to Gradle, isn't unique to Groovy or Kotlin, and isn't unique to IntelliJ. The
problem is the style of code that most build tools require they be configured with.

=== Global Mutable Variables

The fundamental problem with build tools like Gradle is that the entire configuration system
is based around _global mutable variables_. We can see a hint of that in the IDE screenshot
above, where jumping to `compilerArgs` brings us to a _getter_ and _setter_:

```java
public List<String> getCompilerArgs() {
    return this.compilerArgs;
}

public void setCompilerArgs(List<String> compilerArgs) {
    this.compilerArgs = compilerArgs;
}
```

The Groovy or Kotlin code you write does not actually _perform the build_, but instead is
just setting up some global mutable data structure that is used to configure the _real_
build engine that runs _later_. IDEs are generally not good at understanding logic around
global mutable variables, and just because the global mutable variable is wrapped in a
getter and setter does not make it any less global or any less mutable!

This issue with global mutable variables is at the core of why IDEs have trouble with
build tools. It doesn't matter what IDE you are using, and it doesn't matter what language
the build tool is using. If the
build tool is architected around everything being a global mutable variable, then inevitably
the user is going to have a poor IDE experience trying to navigate it.


== Extending Mill

Although Mill also has a programmable build definition syntax, it takes a very different
approach to Gradle, with a very different user and IDE experience:

* While most build tools require users to write plugins against a custom plugin API, Mill allows
you to customize your build using object-oriented methods, classes, and overrides

* While most build tools are configured using global mutable variables, Mill builds are
built on top of classes and methods, providing an API much more familiar to users and
amenable to IDEs

We'll discuss these two ideas more in the examples below.

=== Simple Custom Tasks

Consider the following minimal Mill build with a Java module `foo`. It contains no custom
configuration, and so inherits all the defaults from `mill.javalib.JavaModule`: default
source folder layout, default assembly configuration, default compiler flags, and so on.
This _convention over configuration_ is a philosophy that Mill inherited from Maven and
other JVM build tools:

[source,scala]
----
package build
import mill.*, javalib.*

object foo extends JavaModule {
}
----

[source,console]
----
> mill compile
Compiling 1 Java source...
----

If we want to add a custom task, this is as simple as defining a method.

* Mill's programmable `build.mill` files use Scala syntax, so a method is defined using `def` e.g. `def lineCount = Task { ... }`.

* The body of `Task` performs the action we want, and can depend on other tasks such as `allSourceFiles()`

An implementation of this is shown below

[source,scala]
----
package build
import mill.*, javalib.*

object foo extends JavaModule {
  /** Total number of lines in module source files */
  def lineCount = Task {
    allSourceFiles().map(f => os.read.lines(f.path).size).sum
  }
}
----

Once we define a new task, we can immediately begin using it in our build.
`lineCount` is not used by any existing `JavaModule` tasks, but we can still
show its value via the Mill command line to evaluate it, or inspect its metadata:

[source,console]
----
> ./mill show foo.lineCount
17

> ./mill inspect foo.lineCount
foo.lineCount(build.mill:4)
    Total number of lines in module source files

Inputs:
    foo.allSourceFiles
----

Note that as `lineCount` is a `Task`, we get automatic caching, invalidation, and
parallelization: these are things that every `Task` gets for free, without the task
author to do anything. And although we wrote the `lineCount` logic in the main
`build.mill` file for this example, if it grows complex enough to get messy it is
easy to move it to your own xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc[custom plugins]

=== Overriding Tasks

To wire up `lineCount` into our main `JavaModule` `compile`/`test`/`run` tasks,
one way is to take the line count value and write it to a JVM resource file
to be used at runtime. In Mill everything is a `Task` and every task is a method,
and so JVM resources defined by  `def resources` are no different.
Since it is a method, we can override it and make it depend on `lineCount` in addition
to its prior value `super.resources()` (that references the `resources/` folder on disk):

[source,scala]
----
package build
import mill.*, javalib.*

object foo extends JavaModule {
  /** Total number of lines in module source files */
  def lineCount = Task {
    allSourceFiles().map(f => os.read.lines(f.path).size).sum
  }

  /** Generate resources using lineCount of sources */
  override def resources = Task {
    os.write(Task.dest / "line-count.txt", "" + lineCount())
    super.resources() ++ Seq(PathRef(Task.dest))
  }
}
----


Because our `def resources` overrides the existing `resources` method inherited from `JavaModule`,
the downstream tasks automatically now use the new override instead, similar to any Java
method overrides. That means if you call `mill foo.run`, it will automatically pick up the new
`resources` including the generated `line-count.txt` file and make it available to
the application code to use e.g. to print it out at runtime:

[source,console]
----
> mill foo.run
Line Count: 18
----

Nobody actually wants to count the lines of code in their program and write it in a resource file,
but this example demonstrates how easy it is to extend your Mill module with custom tasks in their
own little custom build pipeline: you just define method ``def``s calling other methods, `override`
methods and call `super` as necessary. These are concepts that any Java developer has been using
daily for decades, and Mill lets you re-use those concepts to configure and customize your build
tool without having to learn a whole new set of build-tool-specific APIs.

=== Mill vs Gradle Configuration as Code

It's worth contrasting the Mill config above with e.g. the
xref:#_extending_gradle[equivalent Gradle configuration] we discussed earlier.

Where Gradle's programmatic configuration is built on top of global mutable variables,
Mill is instead built on ``class``es,  `extends`, method ``def``s and calls, and `overrides`.
These behave exactly as you would expect any object-oriented program to work, so you already
know how Mill behaves even if you've never touched a Mill build before. And the fact
that Mill build config is so much easier to write means that you're much less likely
to have bugs causing slowness or flakiness, resulting in the improved performance
(discussed above) and not needing to regularly run `clean` as you often have to do with other
build tools.

=== Mill IDE Support

One area that Mill does better than Gradle is in providing a seamless IDE
experience. Working with Mill builds in IntelliJ or VSCode, you get the full power of
your IDE to autocomplete, peek at docs, browse signatures, and otherwise navigate
around your build system. Working with your Mill build, you get the same level of
IDE support as working within any Java, Scala, or Kotlin application codebase.

image:comparisons/IntellijOverrideAutocomplete.png[]

The big difference with Mill is that rather than building on global mutable variables, Mill is
built on top of _classes_ and _methods_ like any other JVM codebase. While IDEs struggle
with global variables, they are very good at navigating classes and methods!
For example IntelliJ is able to take your `def javacOptions` override and
find the original definitions that were overridden, and show you where they are defined:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillJavacOptionsParents.png[]

You can jump to any of the overridden ``def``s quickly and precisely:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillJavacOptionsDef.png[]

And because tasks in Mill are just normal methods, IntelliJ is
able to _find usages_, showing you where the task is used. Below, we can see the method
call in the `def compile` task, which uses `javacOptions()` along with a number of other tasks:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillCompile.png[]

From there, if you are curious about any of the other tasks used alongside `javacOptions`, it's
easy for you to pull up _their_ documentation, jump to _their_
definition, or find _their_ usages. For example we can pull up the docs of
`compileClasspath()` below, jump to _its_ implementation, and continue
interactively exploring your build logic from there:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillCompileClasspath.png[]

Unlike most other build tools, Mill build pipelines can be explored interactively in your
IDE. If you do not know what something does, it's documentation, definition, or usages is always
one click away in IntelliJ or VSCode. This isn't a new experience for Java developers, as it
is what you experience every day working in your application code! But Mill brings that same
polished experience to your build system - traditionally something that has been opaque
and hard to understand - and does so in a way that no other build tool does. And this is
possible because Mill builds avoid the global mutable variables common in other build
tools, in favor of configuring your build via classes and methods that are familiar to
both users and to IDEs.

== Templated Graph Computations

Mill has a lot of improvements over build tools like Gradle, but it begs the
question: why can't other build tools improve performance, extensibility, IDE support
as well? It turns out that other tools _have_ been working on improving performance,
extensibility and IDE support - for decades - but Mill does have secret sauce that
makes providing this experience in Mill much easier than providing it in any other build tool.

All build tools are complex, because the requirements of building any size-able real-world
project are complex. One big source of build tool complexity is that users need some way to
define templated graph-computations when setting up their build pipelines.

- *Graph* as the data structure necessary to order and parallelize steps in your build:
  what build step needs to run first, what runs later, what can run in parallel and what cannot

- *Computations* as `.class` files and `.jar` files don't make themselves, and someone
  in Java or Groovy or Kotlin or Bash needs to specify how each step's outputs are made

- *Templated* as different modules in a build are often very similar, with similar pipelines,
  but will also have their differences and idiosyncrasies unique to each module

For example, even a simplified three-module Java build pipeline may look like this, with
each module having its own `sources` and `compile` and `assembly` tasks that form a graph,
and each module looking similar but not quite the same (e.g. `foo.classPath` has no upstream
module, but `bar.classPath` doest)

[graphviz]
....
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  bgcolor=transparent
  newrank=true;
  subgraph cluster_0 {
    style=dashed
    node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
    label = "foo";
    "foo.sources"
    "foo.compile"
    "foo.mainClass"
    "foo.assembly"
    "foo.classPath"
  }
  subgraph cluster_1 {
    style=dashed
    node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
    label = "bar";
    "bar.sources"
    "bar.compile"
    "bar.mainClass"
    "bar.assembly"
    "bar.classPath"
  }
  subgraph cluster_2 {
    style=dashed
    node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
    label = "qux";
    "qux.sources"
    "qux.compile"
    "qux.mainClass"
    "qux.assembly"
    "qux.classPath"
  }
  "foo.sources" -> "foo.compile" -> "foo.classPath" -> "foo.assembly"
  "foo.mainClass" -> "foo.assembly"
  "foo.classPath" -> "bar.compile"   [constraint=false];

  "foo.classPath" -> "bar.classPath"
  "bar.mainClass" -> "bar.assembly"
  "bar.sources" -> "bar.compile" -> "bar.classPath" -> "bar.assembly"

  "bar.classPath" -> "qux.compile" [constraint=false];
  "bar.classPath" -> "qux.classPath"
  "qux.mainClass" -> "qux.assembly"
  "qux.sources" -> "qux.compile" -> "qux.classPath" -> "qux.assembly"
}
....


Most build tools provide ad-hoc config formats (Maven's XML) or programmable builder
APIs (e.g. Gradle's Groovy/Kotlin) to satisfy this need.
But fundamentally, defining an API for templated graph-computations is
non-trivial, so it is not surprising the APIs and to do so can get complicated.

Although the need to define templated graph computations is universal, Mill has one
unique insight in how it can be done more easily.

=== Object-Oriented Builds

Mill has the same requirement of defining templated graph-computations, but
rather than inventing a bespoke programming, configuration and plugin model to do so, Mill
builds upon what everyone already knows: _Object-Oriented Programming_. It turns out that the
object-oriented programming every Java developer learned in school provides all the key
building blocks necessary to define templated graph-computations:

- *Methods* provide a way of defining discrete build steps that perform
some necessary action in your build

- The *Call Graph* between methods provides the build graph, where which method call
which other methods defines the incoming edges of that node in the graph

- *Classes* provide the templating, where you can define a set of methods calling each
other, and instantiate those call graphs more than once in different parts of your build

- *Overrides* and *Subclasses* provide customization: when a particular instance or
sub-class needs a different implementation of one-or-more build steps, you can
override the respective methods to customize the build call graph to your liking

Thus, when you see a Mill build configured as such, with an `object` extending a `class`:

[source,scala]
----
package build
import mill.*, javalib.*

object foo extends JavaModule {
}
----

This is not some special syntax, but is literally defining an object named `foo`
inheriting from the class `JavaModule`. Like any other inheritance, this picks up
the methods and method call graph of `JavaModule` (slightly simplified below)

[graphviz]
....
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  bgcolor=transparent
  newrank=true;
  subgraph cluster_0 {
    style=dashed
    node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
    label = "foo";

    "foo.sources" -> "foo.compile" -> "foo.classPath" -> "foo.assembly"
    "foo.resources" -> "foo.assembly"
  }
}
....

And when you add additional tasks by defining methods using `def`, or `override` tasks
and call `super`:

[source,scala]
----
package build
import mill.*, javalib.*

object foo extends JavaModule {
  /** Total number of lines in module source files */
  def lineCount = Task {
    allSourceFiles().map(f => os.read.lines(f.path).size).sum
  }

  /** Generate resources using lineCount of sources */
  override def resources = Task {
    os.write(Task.dest / "line-count.txt", "" + lineCount())
    super.resources() ++ Seq(PathRef(Task.dest))
  }
}
----

You as a Java programmer already know how these changes affect the build graph, by splicing
in the new method `foo.lineCount`, replacing `foo.resources` with a new method body, and
calling `foo.super.resources`:

[graphviz]
....
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  bgcolor=transparent
  newrank=true;
  subgraph cluster_0 {
    style=dashed
    node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
    label = "foo";

    "foo.sources" -> "foo.compile" -> "foo.classPath" -> "foo.assembly"
    "foo.super.resources" -> "foo.resources" -> "foo.assembly"  [color = darkgreen, penwidth=3]
    "foo.lineCount"  [color = darkgreen, penwidth=3]
    "foo.sources" -> "foo.lineCount" -> "foo.resources" [color = darkgreen, penwidth=3]
    "foo.resources" [color = darkgreen, penwidth=3]
  }
}
....

If we want to re-use your build pipeline customizations, it as simple as turning the
`object foo` into a `class MyJavaModule` (called a `trait MyJavaModule` in Mill's syntax), so it
can be inherited  by `object foo` and `object bar` to share the configuration:


[source,scala]
----
package build
import mill.*, javalib.*

object foo extends MyJavaModule
object bar extends MyJavaModule

trait MyJavaModule extends JavaModule {
  /** Total number of lines in module source files */
  def lineCount = Task {
    allSourceFiles().map(f => os.read.lines(f.path).size).sum
  }

  /** Generate resources using lineCount of sources */
  override def resources = Task {
    os.write(Task.dest / "line-count.txt", "" + lineCount())
    super.resources() ++ Seq(PathRef(Task.dest))
  }
}
----

[graphviz]
....
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  bgcolor=transparent
  newrank=true;
  subgraph cluster_1 {
    style=dashed
    node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
    color = darkgreen
    penwidth=3
    label = "bar";

    "bar.sources" -> "bar.compile" -> "bar.classPath" -> "bar.assembly"
    "bar.super.resources" -> "bar.resources" -> "bar.assembly"
    "bar.lineCount"
    "bar.sources" -> "bar.lineCount" -> "bar.resources"
    "bar.resources"
  }
  subgraph cluster_0 {
    style=dashed
    node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
    label = "foo";

    "foo.sources" -> "foo.compile" -> "foo.classPath" -> "foo.assembly"
    "foo.super.resources" -> "foo.resources" -> "foo.assembly"
    "foo.lineCount"
    "foo.sources" -> "foo.lineCount" -> "foo.resources"
    "foo.resources"
  }

}
....

If we want to further customize either of those modules, you can `override`
one or more of the inherited methods. And if we want to publish our customizations
for others to use in their own projects,
we can xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc#_publishing[publish
MyJavaModule to Maven Central] for others to
xref:extending/import-mvn-plugins.adoc[import into their build].

Mill's usage of methods, classes, and overrides is also what powers the IDE support
discussed earlier on this page. IDEs like IntelliJ or VSCode are uniquely adept at
working with JVM codebases full of methods and classes, and so
they can help you navigate and understand your Mill build pipelines just as easily
as any application codebase. And the simplicity of this extension model is what
allows Mill developers to avoid making mistakes aroun caching or parallelism when setting
up their builds or publishing plugins, which ultimately is what gives Mill builds great
performance without ever needing to `clean`.

== Conclusion

Programmable build tools in the past have a reputation for complexity, and for good reason:
earlier in this article we discussed how xref:#_extending_gradle[] is incredibly error prone
and easy to get wrong, and it's not the only build tool that's like that. _"Don't touch the
build config if you can at all avoid doing so"_ has been a best practice for decades, and
justifiably so given how challenging traditional build tools are to program correctly.

But although superficially Mill's programmable `build.mill` syntax looks similar to Gradle's
`build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`, under the hood it works very differently. Where
Gradle works via a custom DSL that gets and sets global mutable variables that both humans
and IDEs have trouble analyzing, programming a Mill build feels like programming any JVM
application: with classes, methods, and first-class IDE support. With Mill, your build
system is no longer such an impenetrable black box, and instead becomes something that
any JVM developer can safely customize to the needs and requirements of the project.
