= Case Study: Mill vs `sbt`
:page-aliases: Case_Study_Mill_vs_sbt.adoc, Case_Study_Mill_vs_SBT.adoc

This page goes into the weeds comparing the Mill and SBT build tools.
For a higher-level comparison of Mill vs other tools, and why Mill is interesting,
see the page xref:comparisons/why-mill.adoc[].


Compared to `sbt`,

* **Mill makes customizing the build yourself much easier**: most of what build tools
do work with files and call subprocesses, and Mill makes doing that yourself easy.
This means you can always make your Mill build do exactly what you want, and are not
beholden to third-party plugins that may not meet your exact needs or interact well
with each other.

* **Mill is much more performant**: `sbt` has enough overhead that even a dozen
subprojects is enough to slow it down, while Mill can handle hundreds of modules without issue.
Custom tasks in `sbt` re-execute every time, whereas in Mill they are cached automatically.
Mill's watch-for-changes-and-re-run implementation has much lower latency than ``sbt``'s.
The list of ways Mill improves upon ``sbt``'s performance is long, and at the command line you
can really feel it

* **Mill builds are much easier to understand**: Your Mill build is made of bog-standard
``object``s and ``def``s, rather than ``sbt``'s
https://eed3si9n.com/4th-dimension-with-sbt-013/[four-dimensional task matrix].
Your IDE's "*jump-to-definition*" in Mill actually brings you to the implementation of a task, rather
than an `sbt` `taskKey` declaration.
Customizing things is as simple as writing or overriding ``def``s.
The net effect is that despite both tools' build files being written in Scala,
Mill's build files are much easier to understand and maintain.

This page compares using Mill to `sbt`, using the https://github.com/gatling/gatling[Gatling Load Testing Framework] codebase as the example.
Gatling is a medium-sized codebase, 40,000 lines of Scala split over 21 subprojects.
By porting it to Mill, this case study should give you an idea of how Mill compares to `sbt` in more realistic, real-world projects.

In general, in the ideal case Mill and `sbt` have similar performance: caching, parallelism, incremental
compilation, and so on.
Mill's main advantage over `sbt` is its simplicity:

* You do not need to keep a live `sbt` session to maximize performance, exit `sbt` to run Bash commands,
  or juggle multiple terminal windows to run `sbt` in one and Bash in another. Instead, you can just
  run Mill like any command line tool, and Mill caches and parallelizes to maximize performance automatically

* Mill's IDE support is better than ``sbt``'s due to how Mill is designed: peek-at-documentation,
  jump-to-definition, find-overrides, etc. is much more useful since your IDE understands Mill
  much better than it understands `sbt`.

* Mill comes with a lot of useful debugging tools builtin, without needing to juggle external plugins:
  visualizing subproject dependencies, performance profiles, third-party dependency trees. This helps
  you understand what your Mill build is doing.

To do this comparison, we have written a Mill `build.mill` file for the Gatling project. This can be used
with Mill to build and test the various submodules of the Gatling project without needing to
change any other files in the repository:

- https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/blob/main/example/thirdparty/gatling/build.mill[Gatling build.mill file]

== Completeness

The Mill build for Gatling is not 100% complete, but it covers most of the major parts of Gatling:
compiling Scala, running tests.
It does not currently cover linting via https://github.com/diffplug/spotless[Spotless], as that is not built-in to Mill, but it could be added as necessary.

The goal of this exercise is not to be 100% feature complete enough to replace the `sbt` build
today. It is instead meant to provide a realistic comparison of how using Mill in a realistic,
real-world project compares to using `sbt`.

== Performance

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
| Benchmark | Cold `sbt` | Hot `sbt` (rounded) | Mill

| <<Parallel Clean Compile All>> | 34.28s | ≈ 14s | 10.4s
| <<Clean Compile Single-Module>> | 10.1s | ≈ 1s | 0.96s
| <<Incremental Compile Single-Module>> | 6.2s | ≈ 0s | 0.48s
| <<No-Op Compile Single-Module>> | 4.2s | ≈ 0s | 0.40s
|===

`sbt` can be used in two modes, either "cold" run directly from the command line, or "hot"
where an `sbt` session is kept open and commands are run within in. I provide the timings for
both scenarios above, along with the time taken for Mill commands. Mill does not have this
distinction, and can only be run directly from the command line. The Hot `sbt` mode only
reports timings to the nearest second, so that is the number used in this comparison.

The Mill build benchmarks for Gatling is generally much snappier than the cold `sbt` benchmark,
and comparable to that Hot `sbt` benchmark. Mill is marginally faster in the
`Parallel Clean Compile All` benchmark (10s vs 14s), but more importantly does not have the same
_Cold vs Hot_ distinction that `sbt` has: as Mill is always run "cold" from the command line and
keeps the process around to provide "hot" performance automatically.

For the benchmarks above, each provided number is the median wall time of three consecutive runs
on my M1 Macbook Pro. While ad-hoc, these benchmarks are enough to give you a flavor of how
Mill's performance compares to `sbt`. For a fair comparison, we disabled `gatling-build-plugin`
in the sbt setup, which bundles the various scalafmt/scalafix/etc. linters as part of `compile`,
since Mill doesn't bundle them and instead expects them to be invoked separately.

=== Parallel Clean Compile All

[source,console]
----
$ sbt clean; time sbt test:compile
34.28s
32.84s
34.55s

$ sbt

sbt> clean; test:compile
15s
13s
14s

$ ./mill clean; time ./mill -j 10 __.compile
10.7s
9.4s
10.4s
----

This benchmark measures the time taken to parallel compile all the Java and Scala code in
the Gatling code base. We configure Mill to do the same using the same number of threads
(10 on my laptop) as `sbt` uses. As `sbt` runs in parallel by default, we do not have a
comparison for sequential execution times.

=== Clean Compile Single-Module

[source,console]
----
> sbt clean; time sbt gatling-commons/compile
10.1
10.7
10.1

sbt> clean; gatling-common/compile
1s
1s
1s

$ ./mill clean; time ./mill gatling-common.compile
0.96s
0.95s
0.96s
----

This benchmark indicates the use case of clean-compiling a single module. In this case,
the `gatling-commons` module's application code in `commons/, _excluding_ the test code in
and all the downstream submodules.

=== Incremental Compile Single-Module

[source,console]
----
$ echo "" >> gatling-commons/src/main/scala/io/gatling/commons/util/Arrays.scala
$ time sbt gatling-commons/compile
6.6s
6.2s
6.0s

sbt> gatling-commons/compile
0s
0s
0s

$ echo "" >> gatling-commons/src/main/scala/io/gatling/commons/util/Arrays.scala
$ time ./mill gatling-commons.compile
0.49s
0.48s
0.47s
----

This benchmark measures the common case of making a tiny change to a single file and
re-compiling just that module. This is the common workflow that most software developers
do over and over day-in and day-out. We simulate this by appending a new line to the
file `gatling-commons/src/main/scala/io/gatling/commons/util/Arrays.scala`.

Both Mill and `sbt` are able to take advantage of the small code change and re-compile
only the single files needing re-compilation, demonstrating substantial speedups over
the <<Clean Compile Single-Module>> benchmark above. Both Hot `sbt` and "Mill" finish in
a fraction of a second, while Cold `sbt` has substantial overhead.

=== No-Op Compile Single-Module

[source,console]
----
$ time sbt gatling-commons/compile
4.2s
4.2s
4.2s

sbt> gatling-commons/compile
0s
0s
0s

$ time ./mill gatling-commons.compile
0.39s
0.41s
0.40s
----

This benchmark is meant to measure the pure overhead of running the build tool: given a single
module that did _not_ change, the build tool should need to do _nothing_ in response, and so
any time taken is pure overhead.

Again, we see both Hot `sbt` and "Mill" finish in a fraction of a second, with the Mill numbers
showing a ~0.4s overhead to run Mill even when there is no work to do, and the Cold `sbt` has
in comparison substantial >4s overhead.

== IDE Support

One area that Mill does significantly better than `sbt` is in the IDE support.
For example, although IDEs like IntelliJ are nominally able to parse and analyze your `sbt` files, the assistance they can provide is often not very useful.
For example, consider the inspection and jump-to-definition experience of looking into an `sbt` Task:

image::comparisons/IntellijGatlingSbtTask1.png[]
image::comparisons/IntellijGatlingSbtTask2.png[]

Or an `sbt` plugin:

image::comparisons/IntellijGatlingSbtPlugin1.png[]
image::comparisons/IntellijGatlingSbtPlugin2.png[]

In general, although your IDE can make sure the name of the task exists, and the type is correct, it
is unable to pull up any further information about the task: its documentation, its implementation,
usages, any upstream overridden implementations, etc..
Some of this is the limitations of the IDE, but some of it is fundamental: because `sbt` makes the developer define the `val myTask` separate from the assignment of `myTask := something`, jumping to the definition of `myTask` tells you nothing at all: what it does, where it is assigned, etc.

In comparison, for Mill, IDEs like Intellij are able to provide much more intelligence. e.g. when
inspecting a task, it is able to pull up the documentation comment:

image::comparisons/IntellijGatlingMillTask1.png[]

It is able to pull up any overridden implementations of task, directly in the editor:

image::comparisons/IntellijGatlingMillTask2.png[]

And you can easily navigate to the overridden implementations to see where they are defined and
what you are overriding:

image::comparisons/IntellijGatlingMillTask3.png[]

Mill's equivalent of `sbt` plugins are just Scala traits, and again you can easily pull up their
documentation in-line in the editor or jump to their full implementation:

image::comparisons/IntellijGatlingMillPlugin1.png[]
image::comparisons/IntellijGatlingMillPlugin2.png[]

In general, navigating around your build in Mill is much more straightforward than
navigating around your build in `sbt`.
All your normal IDE functionality works perfectly:
jump-to-definition, find-usages, peek-at-documentation, and so on.
Although the Mill and `sbt` builds end up doing the same basic things - compiling Scala, running tests,
zipping up jars - Mill helps de-mystify things considerably so you are never blocked
wondering what your build tool is doing.

== Debugging Tooling

Another area that Mill does better than `sbt` is providing builtin tools for you to understand
what your build is doing.
For example, the Gatling project build discussed has 21 submodules
and associated test suites, but how do these different modules depend on each other?
With Mill, you can run `./mill visualize __.compile`, and it will show you how the
`compile` task of each module depends on the others:

image::comparisons/GatlingCompileGraph.svg[]

Apart from the static dependency graph, another thing of interest may be the performance
profile and timeline: where the time is spent when you actually compile everything.
With Mill, when you run a compilation using `./mill -j 10 __.compile`, you automatically get a
`out/mill-chrome-profile.json` file that you can load into your `chrome://tracing` page and
visualize where your build is spending time and where the performance bottlenecks are:

image::comparisons/GatlingCompileProfile.png[]

If you want to inspect the tree of third-party dependencies used by any module, the
built in `mvnDepsTree` command lets you do that easily:

[source,text]
----
$ ./mill gatling-app.mvnDepsTree
[137/137] gatling-app.mvnDepsTree

----

None of these tools are rocket science, but Mill provides all of them out of the
box in a convenient package for you to use. Whether you want a visual graph layout,
a parallel performance profile, or a third-party dependency tree of your project,
Mill makes it easy and convenient without needing to fiddle with custom configuration
or third party plugins. This helps make it easy for you to explore, understand, and
take ownership of the build tool.

== Conclusion

Both the Mill and `sbt` builds we discussed in this case study do the same thing: they
compile Java and Scala code and run tests.
If set up and used properly, `sbt` builds are performant and do what needs to be done.

Where Mill has an advantage over `sbt` is in its simplicity and understandability.
You do not need to worry about using it "the wrong way" and ending up with workflows running
slower than necessary.
You can explore your build using your IDE like you would any other
project, tracing task dependencies using the same jump-to-definition you use to trace
method calls in your application code.
Mill provides builtin tools to help you navigate, visualize, and understand your build, turning a normally opaque "build config" into something that's transparent and easily understandable.
