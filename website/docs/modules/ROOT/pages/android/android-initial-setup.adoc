= Android Initial Setup
:page-aliases: android_initial_setup.adoc

This page provides an overview of the initial setup required for building Android applications using Mill.

== 1. Install Mill
Don't have Mill installed yet?
You can follow the steps as described in xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc[]

== 2. Install `cmdline-tools` (including `sdkmanager`)

To interact with the Android SDK in a headless or build-tool-friendly way, you need access to `cmdline-tools`, which include the `sdkmanager` utility.

There are two ways to obtain them:

=== Via Android Studio:
If you already have Android Studio installed, `cmdline-tools` may already be installed in `~/Android/Sdk/cmdline-tools/`.
They can also be installed from the GUI through the SDK Manager:

  1. Open Android Studio.
  2. Go to `Settings`.
  3. Navigate to `Languages & Framework` > `Android SDK`.
  4. Switch to the `SDK Tools` tab.
  5. Check the box for `Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)` and click `OK`.

=== Standalone download:
Alternatively, download https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only[cmdline-tools].
Extract the downloaded archive to your Android SDK directory, typically `~/Android/Sdk/cmdline-tools/`.
The structure should look like this:
`$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager`.

If using a custom path, be sure to export the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable accordingly:

[source,bash]
----
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/android/sdk
export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$PATH"
----

Make sure to also accept the licenses in order for mill to install the required SDK components:
[source,bash]
----
yes | sdkmanager --licenses
----


== 3. Create a new Mill project
// The structure of a Mill project can be found in the next android pages like:
The structure of a Mill project and the relative Android commands can be found in the following pages:

- xref:android/java.adoc[]
- xref:android/kotlin.adoc[]
- xref:android/compose-samples.adoc[]
- xref:android/hilt-sample.adoc[]

If you want to start with an example project, you can use the `init` command as shown xref:cli/builtin-commands.adoc[here].

== 4. Use Android Studio
You can use Android Studio to open and work with your Mill project.

== 5. Release the project
By default, mill projects are considered in debug mode, so if your project is ready for release, you should add the following to your app object in the `build.mill` file:
[source,scala]
----
override def androidIsDebug = Task { false }
def androidReleaseKeyName: Option[String] = Some("releaseKey.jks")
def androidReleaseKeyAlias: T[Option[String]] = Task { Some("releaseKey") }
def androidReleaseKeyPass: T[Option[String]] = Task { Some("MillBuildTool") }
def androidReleaseKeyStorePass: T[Option[String]] = Task { Some("MillBuildTool") }
----
Make sure to replace the values with your actual keystore information.
If you don't have a keystore yet, you can create one using the `keytool` command:
[source,bash]
----
keytool -genkey -v -keystore releaseKey.jks -storepass <PASS> -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias releaseKey -keypass <PASS>
----
