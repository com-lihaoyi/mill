= Android Initial Setup
:page-aliases: android_initial_setup.adoc

This page provides an overview of the initial setup required for building Android applications using Mill.

== 1. Install Mill
Don't have Mill installed yet?
You can follow the steps as described in xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc[]

== 2. Android cmdline-tools

Mill requires the Android SDK `cmdline-tools` to build Android applications.

Ensure the `$ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set (typically to `~/Android/Sdk`).

If `cmdline-tools` is missing, Mill will automatically install the `19.0` version.
To override the version, set `cmdlineToolsVersion` in your `build.mill`:
[source,scala]
----
object androidSdkModule0 extends AndroidSdkModule {
  override def cmdlineToolsVersion = Task { "17.0" }
  // Or
  override def cmdlineToolsVersion = Task { "latest" }
}
----

If the SDK package licenses are not accepted, Mill will emit an error message with instructions on how to accept them.


== 3. Create a new Mill project
// The structure of a Mill project can be found in the next android pages like:
The structure of a Mill project and the relative Android commands can be found in the following pages:

- xref:android/java.adoc[]
- xref:android/kotlin.adoc[]
- xref:android/compose-samples.adoc[]
- xref:android/hilt-sample.adoc[]

If you want to start with an example project, you can use the `init` command as shown in xref:cli/builtin-commands.adoc[this] page.

== 4. Use Android Studio
You can use Android Studio to open and work with your Mill project.

== 5. Release the project
By default, mill projects are considered in debug mode, so if your project is ready for release, you should add the following to your app object in the `build.mill` file:
[source,scala]
----
override def androidIsDebug = Task { false }
def androidReleaseKeyName: Option[String] = Some("releaseKey.jks")
def androidReleaseKeyAlias: T[Option[String]] = Task { Some("releaseKey") }
def androidReleaseKeyPass: T[Option[String]] = Task { Some("MillBuildTool") }
def androidReleaseKeyStorePass: T[Option[String]] = Task { Some("MillBuildTool") }
----
Make sure to replace the values with your actual keystore information.
If you don't have a keystore yet, you can create one using the `keytool` command:
[source,bash]
----
keytool -genkey -v -keystore releaseKey.jks \
        -storepass <PASS> -keyalg RSA \
        -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
        -alias releaseKey -keypass <PASS>
