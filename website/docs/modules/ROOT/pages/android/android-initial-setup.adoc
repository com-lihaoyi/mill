= Android Initial Setup
:page-aliases: android_initial_setup.adoc

This page provides an overview of the initial setup required for building Android applications using Mill.

== 1. Install Mill
Don't have Mill installed yet?
You can follow the steps as described in xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc[]

== 2. SDK cmdline-tools

Mill requires the Android SDK `cmdline-tools` to build Android applications.

Ensure the `$ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set (typically to `~/Android/Sdk`).

Mill will automatically install and use the `19.0` version.
To use a different version, override `cmdlineToolsVersion` in your `build.mill`.

[NOTE]
====
The SDK package licenses must be accepted before installing new packages.
If not accepted, Mill will throw an error with instructions.
You can also configure Mill to automatically accept the licenses by overriding `autoAcceptLicenses`.
====

[source,scala]
----
object androidSdkModule0 extends AndroidSdkModule {
  override def cmdlineToolsVersion = "17.0"
  // Or
  override def cmdlineToolsVersion = "latest"

  // Automatically accept licenses
  override def autoAcceptLicenses = true
}
----

[NOTE]
====
This feature is still experimental.
If any issues occur with the automatic installation, you can manually install the `cmdline-tools` package via the Android Studio SDK Manager tab, or download it directly from the https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only[official Android website].

== 3. Create a new Mill project
// The structure of a Mill project can be found in the next android pages like:
The structure of a Mill project and the relative Android commands can be found in the following pages:

- xref:android/java.adoc[]
- xref:android/kotlin.adoc[]
- xref:android/compose-samples.adoc[]
- xref:android/hilt-sample.adoc[]

If you want to start with an example project, you can use the `init` command as shown in xref:cli/builtin-commands.adoc[this] page.

== 4. Use Android Studio
You can use Android Studio to open and work with your Mill project.
