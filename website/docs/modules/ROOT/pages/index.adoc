= Mill: A Better JVM Build Tool

https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/blob/main/changelog.adoc[image:https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.lihaoyi/mill-dist?label=stable-version&versionPrefix={mill-version}&versionSuffix={mill-version}[d]]

Mill is a JVM build tool that supports Java, Scala, and Kotlin:

* Mill builds the same Java project xref:comparisons/why-mill.adoc#_performance[3-6x
 faster than Maven or Gradle] due to aggressive caching & parallelism

* Mill builds require xref:comparisons/why-mill.adoc#_builtins[fewer plugins for common workflows],
and are xref:comparisons/why-mill.adoc#_extending_mill[easier to extend with custom tasks]

* Mill has better IDE support than other build tools, with
xref:comparisons/why-mill.adoc#_ide_support[superior autocomplete and navigation in IntelliJ]

Although the Java compiler is very fast and the Java language is easy to learn,
JVM build tools have a reputation for being sluggish and confusing. Mill tries to
offer a better alternative, letting your build system take full advantage of the
Java platform's performance and usability.

=== Getting Started

To get started using Mill for the first time, or migrating an existing JVM
codebase (built using Maven, Gradle, or SBT) to Mill, see:

Or see the language-specific introductory documentation linked below:

=== Mill Features

* *Performance*: Mill automatically xref:depth/execution-model.adoc#_caching_in_mill[caches]
and xref:depth/parallelism.adoc[parallelizes build tasks] and https://mill-build.org/blog/11-jvm-test-parallelism.html[tests]
to keep local development fast, https://mill-build.org/blog/9-mill-faster-assembly-jars.html[incrementally builds assembly jars]
to speed up manual testing workflows, and shortens CI times with xref:large/selective-execution.adoc[selective test execution]
to only runs the subset of tests necessary to validate a code change.

* *Builtins*: Mill has builtin support for most common workflows: not just compile/run/test, but also
xref:fundamentals/configuring-jvm-versions.adoc[managing JVM versions], xref:javalib/linting.adoc[linting],
xref:javalib/publishing.adoc#_publishing_to_sonatype_maven_central[publishing],
building xref:javalib/publishing.adoc#_building_executable_assemblies[executable assemblies],
xref:javalib/publishing.adoc#_building_native_image_binaries_with_graal_vm[native binaries]
or xref:javalib/publishing.adoc#_java_installers_using_jpackage[installers],
etc. This lets you focus on your actual project and spend less time
fiddling with tooling and plugins.

* *Maintainability*: Mill's config and xref:javalib/intro.adoc#_custom_build_logic[custom logic]
is written in xref:depth/why-scala.adoc[concise type-checked JVM code],
with an immutable xref:depth/design-principles.adoc[module tree and task graph]. This
catches configuration issues early, and helps both humans and IDEs
(xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_intellij[IntelliJ] or
xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_vscode[VSCode])
understand your Mill build better than any other build system

* *Flexibility*: Mill's tasks and modules allow anything from adding
xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc#primitive-tasks[simple build steps], up to
entire xref:extending/example-python-support.adoc[language toolchains].
You can xref:extending/import-mvn-plugins.adoc[import any JVM library] in your build,
use Mill's rich ecosystem of xref:extending/thirdparty-plugins.adoc[Third-Party Mill Plugins],
or xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc[write plugins yourself] and
publish them to Maven Central for others to use.

* *Scalability* Mill scales well from small projects to
xref:large/large.adoc[large monorepos] with hundreds of modules and
xref:large/multi-language-builds.adoc[multiple languages].
Even projects with hundreds or thousands of sub-modules can be handled performantly
and with minimal overhead.

Mill is used to build many real-world projects, such as the
https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0[C3P0 JDBC Connection Pool],
https://github.com/coursier/coursier[Coursier dependency resolver],
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/Ammonite[Ammonite REPL], and the
https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL[SpinalHDL] and
https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel[Chisel] hardware design frameworks.
Mill can be used for applications built on top of common JVM frameworks like
Spring Boot (both xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_spring_boot_todomvc_app[in Java]
and xref:kotlinlib/web-examples.adoc#_spring_boot_todomvc_app[in Kotlin]),
xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_micronaut_todomvc_app[Micronaut],
xref:kotlinlib/web-examples.adoc#_ktor_todomvc_app[Ktor], or
xref:scalalib/web-examples.adoc#_todomvc_http4s_web_app[Http4S].

Mill borrows ideas from other tools like https://maven.apache.org/[Maven],
https://gradle.org/[Gradle], https://bazel.build/[Bazel], but tries to learn from the
strengths of each tool and improve on their weaknesses. For comparisons with existing
build tools, check out these pages:

=== Tool & Framework Support

Mill supports most common JVM development workflows and tools built in, so you can
get very far before you need to reach for third-party plugins or write custom code
to extend your build pipelines. The table
below links to the relevant part of the documentation and examples for each tool:

include::partial$Feature_Support.adoc[]

When the time comes that you do need something not in its builtin feature set, Mill
also has a rich ecosystem of third party plugins for less common use cases:

- xref::extending/thirdparty-plugins.adoc[]
