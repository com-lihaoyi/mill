Mill is a build tool that improves upon the tools traditionally used
in the JVM ecosystem:

* **xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[Simpler than Maven]**, with declarative `build.mill.yaml` files
often 1/10th the lines of a `pom.xml`

* **xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc[Easier than Gradle]** or SBT, with
object-oriented builds any developer can intuitively understand

* **xref:comparisons/performance.adoc[Fastest builds on the JVM]**, 3-7x
faster than Maven or Gradle due to aggressive caching & parallelism

Although the Java compiler is very fast and the Java language is easy to learn, JVM build
tools have a reputation for being sluggish, complicated, and confusing. Mill tries to offer
a better alternative that gives the Java platform the developer experience it deserves.

=== Performance

Mill automatically xref:depth/caching.adoc[caches]
and xref:depth/parallelism.adoc[parallelizes build tasks] and https://mill-build.org/blog/11-jvm-test-parallelism.html[tests]
to keep local development fast, uses a xref:depth/process-architecture.adoc[long-lived daemon] to keep the JVM warm,
and shortens CI times with xref:large/selective-execution.adoc[selective test execution]. Play the
video below to compare compiling the same 500,000 line Netty codebase with Mill (~11s) vs Maven (~60s)

=== Simplicity

Mill's xref:javalib/intro.adoc#_declarative_configuration[declarative
build.mill.yaml files] contain only the essence of what you want to configure in
your build, stripping away the endless complexity in traditional JVM build tools to
make your project configuration easy to write, easy to read, and easy to understand

=== Builtins

Mill supports most common JVM development workflows and tools built in, so you can
get very far before you need to reach for xref::extending/thirdparty-plugins.adoc[third-party plugins] or
write custom code to extend your build system. The example build file below shows
how Mill handles many of the common settings that often need to be configured in a build tool:

```yaml
extends: [JavaModule, PublishModule]

mvnDeps:
- org.thymeleaf:thymeleaf:3.1.1.RELEASE
- org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:2.0.7

repositories: [https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases]

mainClass: foo.Foo2

jvmVersion: 11 # Pin a specific JVM version, supports >=11

# Add additional source and resource folders
sources: !append [custom-src/]
resources: !append [custom-resources/]

# Configure java compiler and runtime options and env vars
javacOptions: [-deprecation]
forkArgs: [-Dmy.custom.property=my-prop-value]
forkEnv: { MY_CUSTOM_ENV: my-env-value }

# Settings to publish to Maven Central
publishVersion: 0.0.1
artifactName: example
pomSettings:
  description: Example
  organization: com.lihaoyi
  url: https://github.com/com.lihaoyi/example
  licenses: [MIT]
  versionControl: https://github.com/com.lihaoyi/example
  developers: [{name: Li Haoyi, email: example@example.com}]
```

Beyond this simple example, the table below links to the relevant part of the
documentation and examples for each feature or tool that Mill supports:

Mill can be used for applications built on top of common JVM frameworks like
Spring Boot (both xref:javalib/spring-boot.adoc[in Java]
and xref:kotlinlib/web-examples.adoc#_spring_boot_todomvc_app[in Kotlin]),
xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_micronaut_todomvc_app[Micronaut],
xref:kotlinlib/web-examples.adoc#_ktor_todomvc_app[Ktor], or
xref:scalalib/web-examples.adoc#_todomvc_http4s_web_app[Http4s].
It is used in the wild to build many real-world projects, such as:

* https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0/blob/0.11.x/build.mill[C3P0 JDBC Connection Pool]
* https://github.com/coursier/coursier/blob/main/build.mill[Coursier dependency resolver]
* https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/Ammonite[Ammonite REPL]
* https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL[SpinalHDL] and https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel/blob/main/build.mill[Chisel] chip design frameworks
