= Mill: A Better JVM Build Tool

https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/blob/main/changelog.adoc[image:https://index.scala-lang.org/com-lihaoyi/mill/mill-main/latest.svg[Mill]]
https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.lihaoyi/mill-dist[image:https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.lihaoyi/mill-dist?label=latest-unstable&versionPrefix=0.12.[Maven Central Version]]

Mill is a JVM build tool that supports Java, Scala, and Kotlin:

* Mill builds the same Java project xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[3-6x faster than Maven]
xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc[or Gradle] due to aggressive caching & parallelism

* Mill has better IDE support than other build tools, with
superior autocomplete and navigation in IntelliJ

* Mill builds require fewer plugins for common workflows,
and are easier to extend with custom tasks

To get started using Mill for the first time, or migrating and existing JVM
codebase (built using Maven, Gradle, or SBT) to Mill, see:

=== Why Mill?

Although the Java compiler is very fast and the Java language is easy to learn,
JVM build tools have a reputation for being sluggish and confusing. Mill tries to
offer a better alternative, letting your build system take full advantage of the
Java platform's performance and usability:

* *Performance*: Mill automatically xref:depth/execution-model.adoc#_caching_in_mill[caches]
and xref:depth/parallelism.adoc[parallelizes build tasks] and https://mill-build.org/blog/11-jvm-test-parallelism.html[tests]
to keep local development fast, https://mill-build.org/blog/9-mill-faster-assembly-jars.html[incrementally builds assembly jars]
to speed up manual testing workflows, and shortens CI times with xref:large/selective-execution.adoc[selective test execution]
to only runs the subset of tests necessary to validate a code change.

* *Builtins*: Mill has builtin support for most common workflows: not just compile/run/test, but also
xref:fundamentals/configuring-jvm-versions.adoc[managing JVM versions], xref:javalib/linting.adoc[linting],
xref:javalib/publishing.adoc#_publishing_to_sonatype_maven_central[publishing],
building xref:javalib/publishing.adoc#_building_executable_assemblies[executable assemblies],
xref:javalib/publishing.adoc#_building_native_image_binaries_with_graal_vm[native binaries]
or xref:javalib/publishing.adoc#_java_installers_using_jpackage[installers],
etc. This lets you focus on your actual project and spend less time
fiddling with tooling and plugins.

* *Maintainability*: Mill's config and xref:javalib/intro.adoc#_custom_build_logic[custom logic]
is written in xref:depth/why-scala.adoc[concise type-checked JVM code],
with an immutable xref:depth/design-principles.adoc[module tree and task graph]. This
catches config issues early, and helps both humans and IDEs
(xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_intellij[IntelliJ] or
xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_vscode[VSCode])
understand your Mill build better than any other build system

* *Flexibility*: Mill's tasks and modules allow anything from adding
xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc#primitive-tasks[simple build steps], up to
entire xref:extending/example-python-support.adoc[language toolchains].
You can xref:extending/import-ivy-plugins.adoc[import any JVM library] in your build,
use Mill's rich ecosystem of xref:extending/thirdparty-plugins.adoc[Third-Party Mill Plugins],
or xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc[write plugins yourself] and
publish them to Maven Central for others to use.

* *Scalability* Mill scales well from small projects to
xref:large/large.adoc[large monorepos] with hundreds of modules and
xref:large/multi-language-builds.adoc[multiple languages].
Even projects with hundreds or thousands of sub-modules can be handled performantly
and with minimal overhead.

Mill is used to build many real-world projects, such as the
https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0[C3P0 JDBC Connection Pool],
https://github.com/coursier/coursier[Coursier dependency resolver],
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/Ammonite[Ammonite REPL], and the
https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL[SpinalHDL] and
https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel[Chisel] hardware design frameworks.
Mill can be used for applications built on top of common JVM frameworks like
Spring Boot (both xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_spring_boot_todomvc_app[in Java]
and xref:kotlinlib/web-examples.adoc#_spring_boot_todomvc_app[in Kotlin]),
xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_micronaut_todomvc_app[Micronaut],
or xref:kotlinlib/web-examples.adoc#_ktor_todomvc_app[Ktor].

Mill borrows ideas from other tools like https://maven.apache.org/[Maven],
https://gradle.org/[Gradle], https://bazel.build/[Bazel], but tries to learn from the
strengths of each tool and improve on their weaknesses. For comparisons with existing
build tools, check out these pages:
