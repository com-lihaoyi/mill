Mill is a build tool that tries to improve upon the tools traditionally used
in the JVM ecosystem:

* **xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[Simpler than Maven]**, with declarative `build.mill.yaml` files
  often 1/10th the lines of a `pom.xml`

* **xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc[Easier than Gradle]**, with 
  object-oriented programmable builds Java developers can intuitively understand

* **xref:comparisons/performance.adoc[Fastest builds on the JVM]**, 3-6x
 faster than Maven or Gradle due to aggressive caching & parallelism

Although the Java compiler is very fast and the Java language is easy to learn,
JVM build tools have a reputation for being sluggish, complicated, and confusing. Mill tries to
offer a better alternative that gives the Java platform the developer experience it deserves.

=== Getting Started

To get started using Mill for the first time, or migrating an existing JVM
codebase (built using Maven, Gradle, or SBT) to Mill, see:

| * xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc[] | * xref:migrating/migrating.adoc[]

Or see the language-specific introductory documentation linked below:

| xref:scalalib/intro.adoc[image:index/iconscout-scala.svg[scala,20] Scala with Mill]
| xref:kotlinlib/intro.adoc[image:index/iconscout-kotlin.svg[kotlin,28] Kotlin with Mill]
|===

=== Mill Features

* *Ergonomic*: Mill provides
xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_bashzsh_tab_completion[terminal tab-completion]
and syntax highlighted command-line output and error messages so developers can easily
navigate their Mill builds and resolve issues.

* *Performance*: Mill automatically xref:depth/caching.adoc[caches]
and xref:depth/parallelism.adoc[parallelizes build tasks] and https://mill-build.org/blog/11-jvm-test-parallelism.html[tests]
to keep local development fast, https://mill-build.org/blog/9-mill-faster-assembly-jars.html[incrementally builds assembly jars]
to speed up manual testing workflows, and shortens CI times with xref:large/selective-execution.adoc[selective test execution]
to only run the subset of tests necessary to validate a code change.

* *Scalability* Mill scales well from xref:javalib/intro.adoc#_single_file_scripts[single-file programs]
to xref:large/large.adoc[large monorepos] with hundreds of modules and
xref:large/multi-language-builds.adoc[multiple languages]. Mill makes building small programs
convenient and large projects performant, so you never need to change toolchains as your project grows.

* *Builtins*: Mill has builtin support for most common workflows: not just compile/run/test, but also
xref:fundamentals/configuring-jvm-versions.adoc[managing JVM versions], xref:javalib/linting.adoc[linting],
xref:javalib/publishing.adoc#_publishing_to_sonatype_maven_central[publishing],
building xref:javalib/publishing.adoc#_building_executable_assemblies[executable assemblies],
xref:javalib/publishing.adoc#_building_native_image_binaries_with_graal_vm[native binaries]
or xref:javalib/publishing.adoc#_java_installers_using_jpackage[installers],
etc. This lets you focus on your actual project and spend less time
fiddling with tooling and plugins.

Mill can be used for applications built on top of common JVM frameworks like
Spring Boot (both xref:javalib/spring-boot.adoc[in Java]
and xref:kotlinlib/web-examples.adoc#_spring_boot_todomvc_app[in Kotlin]),
xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_micronaut_todomvc_app[Micronaut],
xref:kotlinlib/web-examples.adoc#_ktor_todomvc_app[Ktor], or
xref:scalalib/web-examples.adoc#_todomvc_http4s_web_app[Http4S].
It is used in the wild to build many real-world projects, such as:

* https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0/blob/0.11.x/build.mill[C3P0 JDBC Connection Pool]
* https://github.com/coursier/coursier/blob/main/build.mill[Coursier dependency resolver]
* https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/Ammonite[Ammonite REPL]
* https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL[SpinalHDL] and https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel/blob/main/build.mill[Chisel] chip design frameworks
* Projects at https://youtu.be/FckU1aHNh8U?t=2451[Netflix],
https://github.com/disneystreaming/smithy-translate/blob/main/build.sc[Disney-Streaming],
and other organizations

Mill borrows ideas from other tools like https://maven.apache.org/[Maven],
https://gradle.org/[Gradle], https://bazel.build/[Bazel], and
https://www.scala-sbt.org/[sbt], but tries to learn from the
strengths of each tool and improve on their weaknesses. For comparisons with existing
build tools, check out these pages:

=== Tool & Framework Support

Mill supports most common JVM development workflows and tools built in, so you can
get very far before you need to reach for third-party plugins or write custom code
to extend your build pipelines. The table
below links to the relevant part of the documentation and examples for each tool:

include::partial$Feature_Support.adoc[]

When the time comes that you do need something not in its builtin feature set, Mill
also has a rich ecosystem of third party plugins for less common use cases:

- xref::extending/thirdparty-plugins.adoc[]
