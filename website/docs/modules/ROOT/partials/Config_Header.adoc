This page documents the usage of config-based {language} modules defined by
`build.mill.yaml` and `package.mill.yaml` files. These are less flexible but easier
to get started with than the full `build.mill` or `package.mill` build files,
which makes them ideal for small projects which do not need additional flexibility.

This page is not meant to be comprehensive reference, but rather is intended to give
an introduction to Mill's config-based module syntax. For more details on these
topics, see the dedicated pages for each topic linked from the left navigation bar.
