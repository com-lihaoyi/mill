Mill supports three main ways of defining {language} projects:

* xref:#_single_file_scripts[]: small programs with both code and build configuration
  contained within a single file

* xref:#_simple_config_based_modules[]: simple projects that require basic setting
  of dependencies and versions

* xref:#_programmatic_modules[]: builds which require custom logic, e.g.
  code generation or resource processing

This page walks through a series of Mill builds of increasing
complexity to show you the key features and usage of the Mill build tool.
The other pages of this section of the docs go into more depth into individual Mill features.
These aren't intended to be read comprehensively top-to-bottom, but
rather looked up when you have a particular interest e.g. in
xref:{language-small}lib/testing.adoc[testing],
xref:{language-small}lib/publishing.adoc[publishing], and so on.

You can download these example projects using the *download* links below
if you want to try out the commands below yourself, or browse the full sources
of the example (including supporting files) via the *browse* link. the `./mill` script
(`./mill.bat` on windows) takes care of downloading and caching any further dependencies,
including downloading a JVM if you do not already have one. All examples
in this documentation site are executable and are continually exercised as
part of Mill's CI workflows, and they range from the simple hello-world
projects on this page to more sophisticated
xref:{language-small}lib/web-examples.adoc[web build examples] or
xref:{language-small}lib/build-examples.adoc[example
builds for real-world projects]

The API reference for Mill's {language} toolchain can be found at:

If you aren't sure why you would use Mill, see xref:comparisons/why-mill.adoc[] for
a discussion on the motivations of the project. If you are migrating an existing project,
see xref:migrating/migrating.adoc[Migrating to Mill].
