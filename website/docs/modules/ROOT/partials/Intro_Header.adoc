Mill supports three main ways of defining {language} projects:

* xref:#_single_file_scripts[]:
  these are useful for small self-contained programs with both the code and
  configuration contained within a single file

* xref:#_simple_config_based_modules[]: these are a good fit for most simple projects, where you
  may just need to configure a few dependencies or compile/execution flags without any custom logic

* xref:#_programmatic_modules[]: these are necessary
  for scenarios which require custom logic, e.g. custom resource-file processing or code-generation

You can download these examples project using the *download* links above
if you want to try out the commands below yourself, or browse the full sources
of the example (including supporting files) via the *browse* link. the `./mill` script
(`./mill.bat` on windows) takes care of downloading and caching any further dependencies,
including downloading a JVM if you do not already have one. All examples
in this documentation site are executable and are continually exercised as
part of Mill's CI workflows, and they range from the simple hello-world
projects on this page to more sophisticated
xref:{language-small}lib/web-examples.adoc[web build examples] or
xref:{language-small}lib/build-examples.adoc[example
builds for real-world projects]

This page walks through a series of Mill builds of increasing
complexity to show you the key features and usage of the Mill build tool.
The other pages of this section of the docs go into more depth into individual Mill features.
These aren't intended to be read comprehensively top-to-bottom, but
rather looked up when you have a particular interest e.g. in
xref:{language-small}lib/testing.adoc[testing],
xref:{language-small}lib/publishing.adoc[publishing], and so on.

The API reference for Mill's {language} toolchain can be found at:

If you aren't sure why you would use Mill, see xref:comparisons/why-mill.adoc[] for
a discussion on the motivations of the project. If you are migrating an existing project,
see xref:migrating/migrating.adoc[Migrating to Mill].
