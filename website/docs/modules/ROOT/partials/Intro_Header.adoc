This page contains a quick introduction to getting start with using Mill to build
a simple {language} program. It walks through a series of Mill builds of increasing
complexity to show you the key features and usage of the Mill build tool.
The other pages of this section of the docs go into more depth into individual Mill features.
These aren't intended to be read comprehensively top-to-bottom, but
rather looked up when you have a particular interest e.g. in
xref:{language-small}lib/testing.adoc[testing],
xref:{language-small}lib/publishing.adoc[publishing], and so on.

The API reference for Mill's {language} toolchain can be found at:

* {mill-doc-url}/api/latest/mill/{language-small}lib.html[mill.{language-small}lib]

If you aren't sure why you would use Mill, see xref:comparisons/why-mill.adoc[] for
a discussion on the motivations of the project. If you are migrating an existing project,
see xref:migrating/migrating.adoc[Migrating to Mill].
