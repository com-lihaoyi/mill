This page contains a quick introduction to getting start with using Mill to build
a simple {language} program. It walks through a series of Mill builds of increasing
complexity to show you the key features and usage of the Mill build tool.

The other pages of this section of the docs go into more depth into individual features,
with more examples of how to use Mill for {language} and more details of how the Mill
build tool works. They aren't intended to be read comprehensively top-to-bottom, but
rather looked up when you have a particular interest e.g. in
xref:{language-small}lib/testing.adoc[testing],
xref:{language-small}lib/publishing.adoc[publishing], and so on.

The API reference for Mill's {language} toolchain can be found at:
