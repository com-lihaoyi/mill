This page documents the use cases and features of Mill's single-file {language} modules, or "scripts".
These are {language} modules with a single source file, with build configuration included
in a header comment block at the top of the file.

{language} scripts can be standalone or xref:#_project_moduledeps[part of a larger Mill project].
They can be run via `./mill Foo.{language-ext}` from the command line, or have other tasks on
them executed via `./mill Foo.{language-ext}:compile` or `./mill Foo.{language-ext}:assembly`.
Apart from being limited to a single source file, single-file script modules otherwise
support all the same tasks that normal ``{language}Module``s do.
