== Script IDE Integration

Mill's Intellij/VSCode BSP support treats scripts as single-file modules,
but differ in how they are discovered. Typically when importing a project

scripts, skipping certain folders by default:

- `out/`
- `**/src/`
- `**/src-*/`
- `**/resources/`
- `**/out/`
- `**/target/`

While these default script ignore paths should be enough for most projects,
you can add additional folders to this list via `//| bspScriptIgnore: [...]`
in your `build.mill` or `mill-build: bspScriptIgnore: [...]` in your
`build.mill.yaml`. `bspScriptIgnore` takes a sequence of strings that
follow the `.gitignore` syntax, allowing:

- `*` for wildcards within a single path segment
- `**` for wildcards across multiple path segments
- `!` to negate an ignore line.

This can be useful if your proj
