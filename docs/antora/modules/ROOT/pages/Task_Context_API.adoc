= Task Context API

There are several APIs available to you within the body of a `T {...}` or
`T.command {...}` block to help your write the code implementing your Target or
Command:

== `mill.api.Ctx.Dest`

* `T.dest`
* `T.ctx.dest`
* `implicitly[mill.api.Ctx.Dest]`

This is a unique `os.Path` (e.g. `out/classFiles.dest/` or `out/run.dest/`)  that is
assigned to every Target or Command. It is cleared before your task runs, and
you can use it as a scratch space for temporary files or a place to put returned
artifacts.
This is guaranteed to be unique for every `Target` or `Command`, so
you can be sure that you will not collide or interfere with anyone else writing
to those same paths.


== `mill.api.Ctx.Env`

* `T.env`
* `T.ctx.env`
* `implicitly[mill.api.Ctx.Env]`

Mill keeps a long-lived JVM server to avoid paying the cost of recurrent
classloading.
Because of this, running `System.getenv` in a task might not yield
up to date environment variables, since it will be initialised when the server
starts, rather than when the client executes.
To circumvent this, mill's client sends the environment variables to the server as it sees them, and the server makes them available as a `Map[String, String]` via the `Ctx` API.

If the intent is to always pull the latest environment values, the call should
be wrapped in an `Input` as such : 

[source,scala]
----
def envVar = T.input { T.ctx.env.get("ENV_VAR") }
----


== `mill.api.Ctx.Log`

* `T.log`
* `T.ctx.log`
* `implicitly[mill.api.Ctx.Log]`

This is the default logger provided for every task. While your task is running,
`System.out` and `System.in` are also redirected to this logger. The logs for a
task are streamed to standard out/error as you would expect, but each task's
specific output is also streamed to a log file on disk, e.g. `out/run.log` or
`out/classFiles.log` for you to inspect later.

Messages logged with `log.debug` appear by default only in the log files.
You can use the `--debug` option when running mill to show them on the console too.


== `mill.api.Ctx.Workspace`

* `T.workspace`
* `T.ctx.workspace`
*  `implicitly[mill.api.Ctx.Workspace]`

This is the `os.Path` pointing to the project root directory.
This is the preferred access to the project directory, and should always be prefered over `os.pwd` 
(which might also point to the project directory in classic cli scenarios, but might not in other use cases like BSP or LSP server usage).
