= BSP - Build Server Protocol

The contrib.bsp module is now included in mill by default and will eventually replace GenIdea.

Run the following command in the working directory of your project to generate the BSP config:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill mill.bsp.BSP/install
----

== Known Issues:

* Sometimes build from IntelliJ might fail due to a NoClassDefFoundException
being thrown during the evaluation of tasks, a bug not easy to reproduce.
In this case it is recommended to refresh the bsp project.
