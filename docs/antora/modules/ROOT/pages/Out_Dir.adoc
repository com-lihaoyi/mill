= The Output Directory

Mill puts all its output in the top-level `out/` folder.

== Structure of the `out/` Directory

The `out/` folder contains all the generated files & metadata for your build.
It holds some files needed to manage Mill's longer running server instances (`out/mill-*`) as well as a directory and file structure resembling the project's module structure.

<1> The `main` directory contains all files associated with target and submodules of the `main` module.
<2> The `compile` target has tried to access its scratch space via `T.dest`. Here you will find the actual compile results.
<3> Two targets printed something out while they ran. You can find these outputs in the `*.log` files.
<4> Three targets are overridden but re-use the result of their `super`-targets in some way. You can find these result under the `*.super/` path.

== Target Metadata and Cached Files

Each named task (``Target`` or ``Command``) that is run has a representation in the `out/` directory structure.

The _module_ structure is reflected in the directories, so that each module of your project has a uniquely associated subdirectory under the `out/` directory.

Each _target_ is associated with one or multiple files and directories under its module directory.
The following files can be found for a target `foo`:

`foo.json`::
  the cache-key and JSON-serialized return-value of the
`Target`/`Command`.
The return-value can also be retrieved via `mill show foo.compile`.
Binary blobs are typically not included in `foo.json`, and instead stored as separate binary files in `foo.dest/` which are then referenced
by `foo.json` via `PathRef` references.

`foo.dest/`::
  optional, a path for the `Task` to use either as a scratch space, or to place generated files that are returned
using `PathRef` references.
A `Task` should only output files within its own given `foo.dest/` folder (available as `T.dest`) to avoid
conflicting with another `Task`, but can name files within `foo.dest/`  arbitrarily.

`foo.log`::
  optional, the `stdout`/`stderr` of the `Task`. This is also streamed to the console during evaluation.

`foo.super/`::
  optional, holds target metadata for overridden targets, so whenever you use a `super.foo()` in your `foo` target, you will find the metadata of the inherited task(s) under this directory.


The `out/` folder is intentionally kept simple and user-readable.
If your build is not behaving as you would expect,
feel free to poke around the various
`foo.dest/` folders to see what files are being created, or the `foo.json` files to see what is being returned by a
particular task.
You can also simply delete folders within `out/` if you want to force portions of your project to be
rebuilt, e.g. by deleting the `+out/main/+` or `+out/main/compile.*+` folders, but we strongly encourage you to use the xref:Getting_Started.adoc#_clean[`clean` command] instead.

[WARNING]
--
Cleaning some target state by manually deleting files under `out/` may be convenient, but you need to be careful to always delete the `foo.json` file whenever you delete a `foo.dest/` or `foo.super/`. Otherwise, you risk running into hard to diagnose issues later.

Instead, you should always give the `clean` command a try before manually deleting some file under `out/`.

== Other files in the `out/` directory

There are also top-level build-related files in the `out/` folder, prefixed as `mill-*`.

`mill-profile.json`::
 Probably the most useful file for you. It logs the tasks run and time taken for the last Mill command you executed.
This is very useful if Mill is being unexpectedly slow, and you want to find out exactly what tasks are being run.

`mill-par-profile.json`::
 This file is only written if you run Mill in parallel mode, e.g. `mill --jobs 4`. This file can be opened in Google Chrome with the built-in `tracing:` protocol even while Mill is still running, so you get a nice chart of what's going on in parallel.

`mill-worker-*/`::
 Each Mill server instance needs to keep some temporary files in one of these directories. Deleting it will also terminate the associated server instance, if it is still running.
