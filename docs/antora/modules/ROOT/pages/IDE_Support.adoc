= IDE Support
:link-metals: https://scalameta.org/metals/

To support various IDEs and Language Servers, Mill supports the https://build-server-protocol.github.io/[Build Server Protocol] in version {bsp-version} and has a <<Build Server Protocol (BSP),built-in BSP server>>.

In addition to BSP, Mill also supports <<IntelliJ Support,IntelliJ IDEA project configuration generation>> directly.

== Build Server Protocol (BSP)

To install a BSP connection file `.bsp/mill-bsp.json`, run:

[source,bash]
----
mill mill.bsp.BSP/install
----

Working known clients of the BSP server are IntelliJ IDEA and {link-metals}[Metals].

You can fine control some BSP server options by specifying command options:

|===
| Option | Description
|`--jobs` `n` | Use `n` threads in parallel to run tasks. A value of `0` means use as much threads as the system has cpu cores.
|===

*Using Metals*

When using Metals by default Bloop will be used as your build server unless you explicitly choose Mill.
When in a Mill workspace use the "Switch Build Server" command from Metals which will allow you to switch to using Mill as your build
server.
If no `.bsp/mill-bsp.json` file exists, Metals will automatically create it for you and then connect to Mill.

Metals is relying on SemanticDB to enable many of its features.
Mill BSP now also supports to provide this SemanticDB data, when the BSP client (like Metals) requests it.

As of writing this, Metals 0.11.8 is the latest available version, which is not able to detect the fact, that Mill _is_ already providing SemanticDB data.
As a consequence, it reports missing SemanticDB data, although some SemanticDB-based features are already working.
This may be fixed eventually in a future release of Metals.

[CAUTION]
--
*Updating older setups*

In the past, we provided SemanticDB support via `mill.scalalib.bsp.ScalaMetalsSupport` trait, which had to be mixed-in to your Scala modules.
This is no longer needed and deprecated.
You should remove these mix-ins.
`ScalaMetalsSupport` trait is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.

=== Using Bloop (standalone BSP server)

If you wish to use Bloop as your build server (it is the default metals BSP implementation) with metals / vscode, consider using the mill bloop plugin.

xref:Plugin_Bloop.adoc[Bloop Plugin]


This is preferred to the instructions (currently) on the bloop website.



== IntelliJ Support

To generate IntelliJ IDEA project files into `.idea/`, run:

[source,bash]
----
mill mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea
