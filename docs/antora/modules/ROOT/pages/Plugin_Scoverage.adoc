= Scoverage

This module allows you to generate code coverage reports for Scala projects with
https://github.com/scoverage[Scoverage] via the
https://github.com/scoverage/scalac-scoverage-plugin[scalac-scoverage-plugin].

To declare a module for which you want to generate coverage reports you can
extends the `mill.contrib.scoverage.ScoverageModule` trait when defining your
module. Additionally, you must define a submodule that extends the
`ScoverageTests` trait that belongs to your instance of `ScoverageModule`.

.`build.sc`
[source,scala]
----
import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-scoverage:`
import mill.contrib.scoverage.ScoverageModule

object foo extends ScoverageModule  {
  def scalaVersion = "2.12.9"
  def scoverageVersion = "1.4.0"

  object test extends ScoverageTests with TestModule.ScalaTest {
    def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy"org.scalatest::scalatest:3.0.8")
  }
}
----

In addition to the normal tasks available to your Scala module, Scoverage
modules introduce a few new tasks and changes the behavior of an existing one.

[source,bash]
----
mill foo.scoverage.compile      # compiles your module with test instrumentation
                                # (you don't have to run this manually, running the test task will force its invocation)

mill foo.test                   # tests your project and collects metrics on code coverage
mill foo.scoverage.htmlReport   # uses the metrics collected by a previous test run to generate a coverage report in html format
mill foo.scoverage.xmlReport    # uses the metrics collected by a previous test run to generate a coverage report in xml format
----

The measurement data is by default available at `out/foo/scoverage/data/dest`,
the html report is saved in `out/foo/scoverage/htmlReport.dest/`,
and the xml report is saved in `out/foo/scoverage/xmlReport.dest/`.

== Multi-module projects

If you're using Scoverage on a project with multiple modules then an additional
module, `ScoverageReport`, is available to help aggregate the reports from all
``ScoverageModule``s.

Simply define a `scoverage` module at the root of your project as shown:

[source,scala]
----
  object scoverage extends ScoverageReport {
    override def scalaVersion     = "<scala-version>"
    override def scoverageVersion = "<scoverage-version>"
  }
----

This provides you with various reporting functions:

[source,bash]
----
mill __.test                     # run tests for all modules
mill scoverage.htmlReportAll     # generates report in html format for all modules
mill scoverage.xmlReportAll      # generates report in xml format for all modules
mill scoverage.consoleReportAll  # reports to the console for all modules
----

The aggregated report will be available at either `out/scoverage/htmlReportAll.dest/`
for html reports or `out/scoverage/xmlReportAll.dest/` for xml reports.
