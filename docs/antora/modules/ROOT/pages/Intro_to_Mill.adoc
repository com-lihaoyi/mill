{mill-github-url}[Mill] is your shiny new Java/Scala build tool!
http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/SowhatswrongwithSBT.html[Scared of SBT]? Melancholy over Maven? Grumbling about Gradle?
Baffled by Bazel? Give Mill a try!

Mill aims for simplicity by reusing concepts you are already
http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildToolsasPureFunctionalPrograms.html[familiar with], borrowing ideas from modern tools
like https://bazel.build/[Bazel].   
It lets you build your projects in a way that's simple, fast, and predictable.

Mill has built-in support for the https://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala]
programming language, and can serve as a replacement for
http://www.scala-sbt.org/[SBT].  
It can be xref:Extending_Mill.adoc[extended] to support any other language or platform via modules (written in Java or Scala) or through external subprocesses.

If you are using Mill, you will find the following book by the Author useful in using Mill to the fullest:
