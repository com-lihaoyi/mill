= Installation

The best method of installing Mill is to just install a bootstrap script.
This script can determine the best version to be used by a project (e.g. by reading a `.mill-version` file) and will use this exact Mill version.
If that version is not installed locally, it will be downloading for you.

== Bootstrap Scripts

There are currently two bootstrap script available, one <<_mills_bootstrap_script_linuxos_x_only,in the Mill repository>>, which only work for Linux and Unix-like machines, and one <<_millw,external `millw` script>>, with more features and also Windows support.

Using `millw` is recommended.

We plan to merge both script in the future.

=== Mill's Bootstrap Script (Linux/OS-X Only)

If you are using Mill in a codebase, you can commit the bootstrap launcher as a
`./mill` script in the project folder:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
curl -L {mill-github-url}/releases/download/{mill-last-tag}/{mill-version} > mill && chmod +x mill
----

Now, anyone who wants to work with the project can simply use the `./mill`
script directly:

[source,bash]
----
./mill version
./mill __.compile # double underscore
----

The `mill` command will automatically use the version specified by the bootstrap script, even if you installed it via
other means. The `./mill` file has a version number embedded within it, which you can update simply by editing the
script. Note this only works for versions 0.5.0 and above.

Bootstrap scripts are also useful for running Mill in CI, ensuring that your Jenkins/Travis/etc. box has the correct
version of Mill present to build/compile/test your code.

=== millw

Instead of installing Mill directly, you can also use https://github.com/lefou/millw[lefou/millw] as drop-in
replacement for `mill`. It provides a small shell script and also a Windows batch file, that transparently downloads `mill`
and executes it on your behalf. It respects various ways to configure the preferred Mill version (`MILL_VERSION` env
var, `.mill-version` file, `--mill-version` option) and can also be used as a bootstrap script in your project.


== Downloading Mill


=== OS X

Installation via https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/mill.rb[homebrew]:

[source,sh]
----
brew install mill

----

=== Arch Linux

Arch Linux has a https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/mill/[Community package for mill]:

[source,bash]

emerge dev-java/mill-bin

----

=== Windows

To get started, download Mill from
{mill-github-url}/releases/download/{mill-last-tag}/{mill-last-tag}-assembly[Github releases], and save it as `mill.bat`.

If you're using https://scoop.sh[Scoop] you can install Mill via

[source,bash]
----
scoop install mill
----

=== WSL / MSYS2 / Cycgin / Git-Bash

Mill also works on "sh" environments on Windows (e.g.,
https://www.msys2.org[MSYS2],
https://www.cygwin.com[Cygwin],
https://gitforwindows.org[Git-Bash],
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl[WSL]); to get started, follow the instructions in the <<_manual>>
section. Note that:

* In some environments (such as WSL), Mill might have to be run without a server (using `-i`, `--interactive`, `--no-server`, or `--repl`.)

* On Cygwin, run the following after downloading mill:

[source,bash]
----
sed -i '0,/-cp "\$0"/{s/-cp "\$0"/-cp `cygpath -w "\$0"`/}; 0,/-cp "\$0"/{s/-cp "\$0"/-cp `cygpath -w "\$0"`/}' /usr/local/bin/mill
----

=== Docker

You can download and run
a https://hub.docker.com/r/nightscape/scala-mill/["Docker image containing OpenJDK, Scala and Mill"] using

[source,bash]
----
docker pull nightscape/scala-mill
docker run -it nightscape/scala-mill
----

=== Manual

To get started, download Mill and install it into your HOME ".local/bin" via the following
`curl`/`chmod` command:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
sh -c "curl -L {mill-github-url}/releases/download/{mill-last-tag}/{mill-last-tag} > ~/.local/bin/mill && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/mill"
----

=== Coursier (unsupported)

Installing mill via `coursier` or `cs` is currently not officially supported. There are various issues, especially with
interactive mode.


== Updating Mill

If you have installed Mill via the recommended <<_bootstrap_scripts,`Bootstrap Script`>> method, you don't need to install multiple version of Mill explicitly.

Follow the next <<_overriding_mill_versions>> section for details.

== Overriding Mill Versions


Apart from downloading and installing new versions of Mill globally, there are a few ways of selecting/updating your Mill version. This will only work, if you have choosen one of the <<_bootstrap_scripts,Boostrap script methods>>:

* Create a `.mill-version` file to specify the version of Mill you wish to use:
[source,bash]
----
echo "0.5.0" > .mill-version
----

`.mill-version` takes precedence over the version of Mill specified in the
`./mill` script.

* Pass in a `MILL_VERSION` environment variable, e.g.
[source,bash]
----
MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb mill __.compile
----

or

[source,bash]
----
MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb ./mill __.compile
----

to override the Mill version manually. This takes precedence over the version specified in `./mill` or `.mill-version`

=== Automatic Mill updates

If your project is hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you can use https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward[Scala Steward] to automatically open a pull request to update your Mill version (in `.mill-version` file), whenever there is a newer version available.

TIP: Scala Steward can also xref:Configuration.adoc#_keeping_up_to_date_with_scala_steward[scan your project dependencies] and keep them up-to-date.

=== Development Releases

In case you want to try out the latest features and improvements that are currently in the main branch, unstable versions of Mill
are
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/releases[available] as binaries named
`+#.#.#-n-hash+` linked to the latest tag.

The easiest way to use a development release is to use one of the <<_bootstrap_scripts>>, which support
<<_overriding_mill_versions>> via an `MILL_VERSION` environment variable or a `.mill-version` file.
