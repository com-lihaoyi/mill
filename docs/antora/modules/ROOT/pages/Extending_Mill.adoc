= Extending Mill
:link-ammonite: https://ammonite.io/

There are different ways of extending Mill, depending on how much customization and flexibility you need.
This page will go through your options from the easiest/least-flexible to the hardest/most-flexible.

== Custom Targets & Commands

The simplest way of adding custom functionality to Mill is to define a custom Target or Command:

[source,scala]
----
def foo = T { ... }
def bar(x: Int, s: String) = T.command { ... }

----

These can depend on other Targets, contain arbitrary code, and be placed top-level or within any module.
If you have something you just want to _do_ that isn't covered by the built-in ``ScalaModule``s/``ScalaJSModule``s, simply write a custom Target (for cached computations) or Command (for un-cached actions) and you're done.

For subprocess/filesystem operations, you can use the
https://github.com/lihaoyi/os-lib[os-lib] library that comes bundled with Mill, or even plain `java.nio`/`java.lang.Process`.
Each target gets its own
xref:Task_Context_API.adoc#_mill_api_ctx_dest[T.dest] folder that you can use to place files without worrying about colliding with other targets.

This covers use cases like:

=== Compile some Javascript with Webpack and put it in your runtime classpath:

[source,scala]
----
def doWebpackStuff(sources: Seq[PathRef]): PathRef = ???

def javascriptSources = T.sources { millSourcePath / "js" }
def compiledJavascript = T { doWebpackStuff(javascriptSources()) }
object foo extends ScalaModule {
  def runClasspath = T { super.runClasspath() ++ compiledJavascript() }
}
----

=== Deploy your compiled assembly to AWS

[source,scala]
----
object foo extends ScalaModule {}

def deploy(assembly: PathRef, credentials: String) = ???

def deployFoo(credentials: String) = T.command {
  deploy(foo.assembly(), credentials)
}
----

== Custom Workers

<<_custom_targets_commands>> are re-computed from scratch each time; sometimes you want to keep values around in-memory when using
`--watch` or the Build REPL.

In such a case, you can use a `Worker`. Workers keep their state between multiple runs. Workers are created with the `T.worker` macro.

.Example: Keep a webpack process running so webpack's own internal caches are hot and compilation is fast
[source,scala]
----
def webpackWorker = T.worker {
  // Spawn a process using java.lang.Process and return it
}

def javascriptSources = T.sources { millSourcePath / "js" }

def doWebpackStuff(webpackProcess: Process, sources: Seq[PathRef]): PathRef =
  ???

def compiledJavascript = T {
  doWebpackStuff(webpackWorker(), javascriptSources())
}
----

Mill itself uses ``T.worker``s for its built-in Scala support: we keep the Scala compiler in memory between compilations, rather than discarding it each time, in order to improve performance.

== Custom Modules

[source,scala]
----
trait FooModule extends mill.Module {
  def bar = T { "hello" }
  def baz = T { "world" }
}
----

Custom modules are useful if you have a common set of tasks that you want to re-use across different parts of your build.
You simply define a `trait`
inheriting from `mill.Module`, and then use that `trait` as many times as you want in various ``object``s:

[source,scala]
----
object foo1 extends FooModule
object foo2 extends FooModule {
  def qux = T { "I am Cow" }
}  
----

You can also define a `trait` extending the built-in `ScalaModule` if you have common configuration you want to apply to all your ``ScalaModule``s:

[source,scala]
----
trait FooModule extends ScalaModule {
  def scalaVersion = "2.11.11"
  object test extends Tests with TestModule.ScalaTest {
    def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy"org.scalatest::scalatest:3.0.4")
  }
}
----

In fact, the above example of a configuration trait is so convenient, that it is found in almost any non-trivial Mill project, in once form or another.

== import $file

If you want to define some functionality that can be used both inside and outside the build, you can create a new `foo.sc` file next to your `build.sc`,
`import $file.foo`, and use it in your `build.sc` file:

.`foo.sc`
[source,scala]
----
def fooValue() = 31337
----

.`build.sc`
[source,scala]
----
import $file.foo
def printFoo() = T.command { println(foo.fooValue()) }
----

Mill's `import $file` syntax supports the full functionality of
{link-ammonite}#ScalaScripts[Ammonite Scripts]

== import $ivy

If you want to pull in artifacts from the public repositories (e.g. Maven Central) for use in your build, you can simply use `import $ivy`.


.Example `build.sc`: Using `scalatags` library to generate HTML
[source,scala]
----
import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::scalatags:0.6.2` // <1>

def generatedHtml = T {
  import scalatags.Text.all._ // <2>
  html(
    head(),
    body(
      h1("Hello"),
      p("World")
    )
  ).render  
}
----
<1> Import the scalatags library from Mavel Central repository.
<2> Creates the `generatedHtml` target which is used here to generate a simple Hello World HTML document. It can be used however you would like: written to a file, further processed, etc.

Please also read the section xref:Using_Plugins.adoc[].

For more information about this special `import` syntax, read the
{link-ammonite}#import$ivy[Ammonite Documentation for Ivy Dependencies].


== Evaluator Commands (experimental)

_Evaluator Command are experimental and suspected to change.
See {mill-github-url}/issues/502[issue #502] for details._

You can define a command that takes in the current `Evaluator` as an argument, which you can use to inspect the entire build, or run arbitrary tasks.
For example, here is the `mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea` command which uses this to traverse the module-tree and generate an Intellij project config for your build.

[source,scala]
----
def idea(ev: Evaluator) = T.command {
  mill.scalalib.GenIdea(
    implicitly,
    ev.rootModule,
    ev.discover
  )
}
----

Many built-in tools are implemented as custom evaluator commands:
xref:Getting_Started.adoc#_inspect[inspect],
xref:Getting_Started.adoc#_resolve[resolve],
xref:Getting_Started.adoc#_show[show].
If you want a way to run Mill commands and programmatically manipulate the tasks and outputs, you do so with your own evaluator command.
