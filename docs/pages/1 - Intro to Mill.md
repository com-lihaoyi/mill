[Mill](https://github.com/lihaoyi/mill) is your shiny new Scala build tool!
[Scared of SBT](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/SowhatswrongwithSBT.html)?
Melancholy over Maven? Grumbling about Gradle? Baffled by Bazel? Give Mill a
try!

Mill aims for simplicity by re-using concepts you are already
[familiar with](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildToolsasPureFunctionalPrograms.html),
borrowing ideas from modern tools like [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), to let you
build your projects in a way that's simple, fast, and predictable.

Mill has built in support for the [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
programming language, and can serve as a replacement for
[SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), but can also be
[extended](http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/page/extending-mill.html) to support any
other language or platform via modules (written in Java or Scala) or through
external subprocesses.

To get started, download Mill and install it into your system via the following
`curl`/`chmod` command:

```bash
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/mill https://github.com/lihaoyi/mill/releases/download/0.1.3/0.1.3 && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mill
```

More recent, unstable versions of Mill are also
[available](https://github.com/lihaoyi/mill/releases/tag/unstable), if you want
to try out the latest features and improvements that are currently in master. 
Come by our [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/lihaoyi/mill) if you want to ask
questions or say hi!

The simplest Mill build for a Scala project looks as follows:

```scala
// build.sc
import mill._
import mill.scalalib._

object foo extends ScalaModule {
  def scalaVersion = "2.12.4"
}
```

This would build a project laid out as follows:

```
build.sc
foo/
    src/
        Main.scala
    resources/
        ...
out/
    foo/
        ... 
```

You can download an example project with this layout here:

- [Example 1](example-1.zip)

The source code for this module would live in the `foo/src/` folder, matching
the name you assigned to the module. Output for this module (compiled files,
resolved dependency lists, ...) would live in `out/foo/`.

This can be run from the Bash shell via:

```bash
$ mill foo.compile                 # compile sources into classfiles

$ mill foo.run                     # run the main method, if any

$ mill foo.launcher                # prepares a foo/launcher/dest/run you can run later

$ mill foo.jar                     # bundle the classfiles into a jar

$ mill foo.assembly                # bundle classfiles and all dependencies into a jar
 
$ mill foo.console                 # start a Scala console within your project
 
$ mill foo.repl                    # start an Ammonite REPL within your project 
```

You can run `mill resolve __` to see a full list of the different tasks that are
available, `mill resolve foo._` to see the tasks within `foo`, `mill describe
foo.compile` to see what an individual task depends on, or `mill show
foo.scalaVersion` to inspect the output of any task.

The most common **tasks** that Mill can run are cached **targets**, such as
`compile`, and un-cached **commands** such as `foo.run`. Targets do not
re-evaluate unless one of their inputs changes, where-as commands re-run every
time.

## Output

Mill puts all it's output in the top-level `out/` folder. The above commands
would end up in:

```text
out/
    foo/
        compile/
        run/
        jar/
        assembly/
```

Within the output folder for each task, there's a `meta.json` file containing
the metadata returned by that task, and a `dest/` folder containing any files
that the task generates. For example, `out/foo/compile/dest/` contains the
compiled classfiles, while `out/foo/assembly/dest/` contains the self-contained
assembly with the project's classfiles jar-ed up with all it's dependencies.

Given a task `foo.bar`, all it's output and results can be found be within it's
respective `out/foo/bar/` folder.

## Multiple Modules

```scala
// build.sc
import mill._
import mill.scalalib._
object foo extends ScalaModule {
  def scalaVersion = "2.12.4"
}
object bar extends ScalaModule {
  def moduleDeps = Seq(foo)
  def scalaVersion = "2.12.4"
}
```

You can define multiple modules the same way you define a single module, using
`def moduleDeps` to define the relationship between them. The above build
expects the following project layout:

```
build.sc
foo/
    src/
        Main.scala
    resources/
        ...
bar/
    src/
        Main2.scala
    resources/
        ...
out/
    foo/
        ... 
    bar/
        ... 
```

And can be built/run using:

```bash
$ mill foo.compile        
$ mill bar.compile        

$ mill foo.run            
$ mill bar.run            

$ mill foo.jar            
$ mill bar.jar            

$ mill foo.assembly        
$ mill bar.assembly        
```

Mill's evaluator will ensure that the modules are compiled in the right order,
and re-compiled as necessary when source code in each module changes.

Modules can also be nested:

```scala
// build.sc
import mill._
import mill.scalalib._
object foo extends ScalaModule {
  def scalaVersion = "2.12.4"
  object bar extends ScalaModule {
    def moduleDeps = Seq(foo)
    def scalaVersion = "2.12.4"
  }
}
```

Which would result in a similarly nested project layout:

```
build.sc
foo/
    src/
        Main.scala
    resources/
        ...
    bar/
        src/
            Main2.scala
        resources/
            ...
out/
    foo/
        ...
        bar/
            ...
```

Where the nested modules can be run via:

```bash
$ mill foo.compile        
$ mill foo.bar.compile        

$ mill foo.run            
$ mill foo.bar.run            

$ mill foo.jar            
$ mill foo.bar.jar            

$ mill foo.assembly        
$ mill foo.bar.assembly        
```

## Watch and Re-evaluate

You can use the `--watch` flag to make Mill watch a task's inputs, re-evaluating
the task as necessary when the inputs change:

```bash
$ mill --watch foo.compile 
$ mill --watch foo.run 
```

Mill's `--watch` flag watches both the files you are building using Mill, as
well as Mill's own `build.sc` file and anything it imports, so any changes to
your `build.sc` will automatically get picked up.

## Command-line Tools

Mill comes built in with a small number of useful command-line utilities:

### all

```bash
mill all foo.{compile,run}
mill all "foo.{compile,run}"
mill all foo.compile foo.run
mill all _.compile # run compile for every top-level module
mill all __.compile  # run compile for every module
```

`all` runs multiple tasks in a single command

### resolve

```bash
$ mill resolve _
main
moduledefs
core
scalaworker
scalalib
scalajslib
integration
testRepos
...

$ mill resolve _.compile

main.compile
moduledefs.compile
core.compile
scalaworker.compile
scalalib.compile
scalajslib.compile
integration.compile

$ mill resolve core._

core.test
core.compile
core.publishVersion
core.runClasspath
core.testArgs
core.sources
...
```

`resolve` lists the tasks that match a particular query, without running them.
This is useful for "dry running" an `mill all` command to see what would be run
before you run them, or to explore what modules or tasks are available from the
command line using `resolve _`, `resolve foo._`, etc.

```bash
mill resolve foo.{compile,run}
mill resolve "foo.{compile,run}"
mill resolve foo.compile foo.run
mill resolve _.compile          # list the compile tasks for every top-level module
mill resolve __.compile         # list the compile tasks for every module
mill resolve _                  # list every top level module or task
mill resolve foo._              # list every task directly within the foo module
mill resolve __                 # list every module or task recursively
mill resolve foo.__             # list every task recursively within the foo module
```

### describe

```bash
$ mill describe core.run

core.run(ScalaModule.scala:211)
Inputs:
    core.mainClass
    core.runClasspath
    core.forkArgs
    core.forkEnv
```

`describe` is a more verbose version of [resolve](#resolve). In addition to
printing out the name of one-or-more tasks, it also display's it's source
location and a list of input tasks. This is very useful for debugging and
interactively exploring the structure of your build from the command line.

`describe` also works with the same `_`/`__` wildcard/query syntaxes that
[all](#all)/[resolve](#resolve) do:


```bash
mill describe foo.compile
mill describe foo.{compile,run}
mill describe "foo.{compile,run}"
mill describe foo.compile foo.run
mill describe _.compile
mill describe __.compile
mill describe _
mill describe foo._
mill describe __
mill describe foo._
```

### show

```bash
$ mill show core.scalaVersion
"2.12.4"
```

By default, Mill does not print out the metadata from evaluating a task. Most
people would not be interested in e.g. viewing the metadata related to
incremental compilation: they just want to compile their code! However, if you
want to inspect the build to debug problems, you can make Mill show you the
metadata output for a task using the `show` command:

All tasks return values that can be `show`n, not just configuration values. e.g.
`compile` returns that path to the `classes` and `analysisFile` that are
produced by the compilation:

```bash
$ mill show foo.compile
{
    "analysisFile": "/Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test/out/foo/compile/dest/zinc",
    "classes": {
        "path": "/Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test/out/foo/compile/dest/classes"
    }
}
```

`show` is generally useful as a debugging tool, to see what is going on in your
build:

```bash
$ mill show foo.sources
[
    {"path": "/Users/lihaoyi/Dropbox/Github/test/foo/src"}
]

$ mill show foo.compileDepClasspath
[
    {"path": ".../org/scala-lang/scala-compiler/2.12.4/scala-compiler-2.12.4.jar"},
    {"path": ".../org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.12.4/scala-library-2.12.4.jar"},
    {"path": ".../org/scala-lang/scala-reflect/2.12.4/scala-reflect-2.12.4.jar"},
    {"path": ".../org/scala-lang/modules/scala-xml_2.12/1.0.6/scala-xml_2.12-1.0.6.jar"}
]
```

`show` is also useful for interacting with Mill from external tools, since the
JSON it outputs is structured and easily parsed & manipulated.

## IntelliJ Support

Mill supports IntelliJ by default. Use `mill mill.scalalib.GenIdeaModule/idea` to
generate an IntelliJ project config for your build.

This also configures IntelliJ to allow easy navigate & code-completion within
your build file itself.

## The Build Repl

```bash
$ mill -i
Loading...
@ foo
res1: foo.type = ammonite.predef.build#foo:2
Commands:
    .runLocal(args: String*)()
    .run(args: String*)()
    .runMainLocal(mainClass: String, args: String*)()
    .runMain(mainClass: String, args: String*)()
    .console()()
Targets:
    .allSources()
    .artifactId()
    .artifactName()
...

@ foo.compile
res3: mill.package.T[mill.scalalib.CompilationResult] = mill.scalalib.ScalaModule#compile:152
Inputs:
    foo.scalaVersion
    foo.allSources
    foo.compileDepClasspath
...
    
@ foo.compile()
res2: mill.scalalib.CompilationResult = CompilationResult(
  root/'Users/'lihaoyi/'Dropbox/'Github/'test/'out/'foo/'compile/'dest/'zinc,
  PathRef(root/'Users/'lihaoyi/'Dropbox/'Github/'test/'out/'foo/'compile/'dest/'classes, false)
)
```

You can run `mill` alone to open a build REPL; this is a Scala console with your
`build.sc` loaded, which lets you run tasks interactively. The task-running
syntax is slightly different from the command-line, but more in-line with how
you would depend on tasks from within your build file.

You can use this REPL to run build commands quicker, due to keeping the JVM warm
between runs, or to interactively explore your build to see what is available.

## Deploying your code

The two most common things to do once your code is complete is to make an
assembly (e.g. for deployment/installation) or publishing (e.g. to Maven
Central). Mill comes with both capabilities built in.

Mill comes built-in with the ability to make assemblies. Given a simple Mill
build:

```scala
// build.sc
import mill._, scalalib._

object foo extends ScalaModule{
  def scalaVersion = "2.12.4"
}
```

You can make a self-contained assembly via:

```bash
$ mill foo.assembly

$ ls -lh out/foo/assembly/dest/out.jar
-rw-r--r--  1 lihaoyi  staff   5.0M Feb 17 11:14 out/foo/assembly/dest/out.jar
```

You can then move the `out.jar` file anywhere you would like, and run it
standalone using `java`:

```bash
$ java -cp out/foo/assembly/dest/out.jar foo.Example
Hello World!
```

To publish to Maven Central, you need to make `foo` extend Mill's
`PublishModule` trait:

```scala
// build.sc
import mill._, scalalib._, publish._

object foo extends PublishModule{
  def scalaVersion = "2.12.4"
  def publishVersion = "0.0.1"

  def pomSettings = PomSettings(
    description = "Hello",
    organization = "com.lihaoyi",
    url = "https://github.com/lihaoyi/example",
    licenses = Seq(License.MIT),
    versionControl = VersionControl.github("lihaoyi", "example"),
    developers = Seq(
      Developer("lihaoyi", "Li Haoyi","https://github.com/lihaoyi")
    )
  )
}
```

You can download an example project with this layout here:

- [Example 2](example-2.zip)

Which you can then publish using the `mill foo.publish` command, which takes
your sonatype credentials (e.g. `lihaoyi:foobarbaz`) and GPG password as inputs:

```bash
$ mill foo.publish
Missing arguments: (--sonatypeCreds: String, --gpgPassphrase: String, --release: Boolean)

Arguments provided did not match expected signature:

publish
  --sonatypeCreds  String (format: "username:password")
  --gpgPassphrase  String
  --release        Boolean
```

You also need to specify `release` as `true` or `false`, depending on whether
you just want to stage your module on `oss.sonatype.org` or you want Mill to
complete the release process to Maven Central.

If you are publishing multiple artifacts, you can also use `target/bin/mill
mill.scalalib.PublishModule/publishAll1 as described
[here](http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/page/common-project-layouts.html#publishing)
