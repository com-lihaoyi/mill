= Installation and IDE Support
:page-aliases: Installation.adoc, IDE_Support.adoc

The best method of installing Mill is to just install a <<_bootstrap_scripts,bootstrap script>>.
This script can determine the best version to be used by a project (e.g. by
reading a `.mill-version` or `.config/mill-version` file or a `MILL_VERSION` environment variable) and will use this exact Mill version.
If the determined Mill version is not installed locally, it will be downloaded automatically.

[#_bootstrap_scripts]
== Bootstrap Scripts

There are currently two bootstrap script available:

* the rather simple `mill` script <<_mills_bootstrap_script_linuxos_x_only,in the root of th Mill repository>>, which only works on Linux and Unix-like machines, or
* <<_millw,the `lefou/millw` script>>, an external project with more features and more supported platforms.

Using `millw` is recommended.
We plan to merge both script in the future.

In general, bootstrap scripts are the recommended way of installing Mill,
because they reduce the chance of errors due to the installed version of Mill
being incompatible with the version expected by your build.

All bootstrap scripts can be installed globally and/or per project.

=== Global installation

After installing the script in a global or user-wide location, you can use it everywhere.
If it detects project-specific configuration of the Mill version, it will download and use this exact version.

=== Project-specific installation

You can also add the script to your project as `mill`.
This makes it easier for new contributors to build your project, as they don't have to install Mill before they can start.
Anyone who wants to work with the project can simply use the `./mill` script directly.

[source,bash]
----
./mill --version
./mill __.compile # double underscore
----

In-project bootstrap scripts are also useful for running Mill in CI/CD, ensuring
that your build server like Jenkins or Github Actions has the correct version of Mill present to build, compile or test your code.

[#_mills_bootstrap_script_linuxos_x_only]
=== Mill's in-repo Bootstrap Script (Linux/OS-X Only)

You can find this script in the root of the Mill repository, or on each release page.
To get the latest version run the following command:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
curl -L {mill-github-url}/releases/download/{mill-last-tag}/{mill-last-tag} > mill && chmod +x mill
----

The `mill` command will automatically use the version specified by the
bootstrap script, even if you installed it via other means.
The `./mill` file has a version number embedded within it, which you can update simply by editing the script.

=== `millw`

You can also use https://github.com/lefou/millw[lefou/millw] as a drop-in replacement for `mill`.
This script is a bit more advanced, and supports running on all major platforms including MS Windows.

The script supports to following sources when determining the best Mill version to use:

* `MILL_VERSION` environment variable
* `.mill-version` file in the project directory
* `.config/mill-version` file in the project directory
* if non was defined so far, it can also check for the latest available version online
* `DEFAULT_MILL_VERSION` environment variable

Using a system-wide installed `millw` is probably the robustest way to use Mill on any operating system.
It also preserves support of rather old Mill versions next to recent ones, so that updating it or switching to `millw` initially should be a no-brainer.


== Other installation methods

Of course, you can also use the package manager of your operating system or distribution.
Please keep in mind, that all those solutions listed below are maintained outside of Mill and may not have the same features as the <<_bootstrap_scripts,bootstrap scripts>>.

CAUTION: Some of the installations via package managers install a fixed version of Mill and do not support project-specific selection of the preferred Mill version. If you want to use the `MILL_VERSION` environment variable or need support for `.mill-version` or `.config/mill-version` files to control the actual used Mill version, please use a <<_bootstrap_scripts,Bootstrap script>> instead.

----

=== Coursier (unsupported)

Installing mill via `coursier` or `cs` is currently not officially supported.
There are various issues, especially with interactive mode.

== IDE Support
:link-metals: https://scalameta.org/metals/

To support various IDEs and Language Servers, Mill supports the
https://build-server-protocol.github.io/[Build Server Protocol] in version
{bsp-version} and has a <<Build Server Protocol (BSP),built-in BSP server>>.

In addition to BSP, Mill also supports
<<IntelliJ IDEA Support,IntelliJ IDEA project configuration generation>>
directly.


=== Build Server Protocol (BSP)

The Build Server Protocol has the concept of BSP server discovery, which means:
A BSP client can connect to any BSP server, as long as there is a connection
file under the `.bsp/` directory.

To install a BSP connection file `.bsp/mill-bsp.json` for Mill, run:

[source,bash]
----
mill mill.bsp.BSP/install
----

Working known clients of the BSP server are IntelliJ IDEA and {link-metals}[Metals].

You can fine control some BSP server options by specifying command options:

|===
| Option | Description
|`--jobs` `n` | Use `n` threads in parallel to run tasks. A value of `0` means
to use as many threads as the system has cpu cores.
|===

[NOTE]
--
*Using Metals*

When using Metals by default Bloop will be used as your build server unless
you explicitly choose Mill. When in a Mill workspace use the "Switch Build
Server" command from Metals which will allow you to switch to using Mill as
your build server. If no `.bsp/mill-bsp.json` file exists, Metals will
automatically create it for you and then connect to Mill.
--

[CAUTION]
--
*Updating older setups*

In the past, we provided SemanticDB support via `mill.scalalib.bsp.ScalaMetalsSupport`
trait, which had to be mixed-in to your Scala modules. This is no longer needed and
deprecated. You should remove these mix-ins.
`ScalaMetalsSupport` trait is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.
--

=== If things go wrong

In case things go wrong, it can be sometimes hard to find the cause.
BSP is just a protocol, and as such, issues on the server side (the Mill BSP
server) might not well propagated to the BSP client (your IDE).

For that reason Mill BSP server is writing a log file under
`.bsp/mill-bsp.stderr`, where you can find various information about what's
going on. Its content should look familiar, as it contains regular Mill
output accompanied by additional BSP client-server communication details.

You can increase the verbosity of that log file, when you run Mill with
`--debug` at installation time (of the BSP discovery file).

[source,bash]
----
mill --debug mill.bsp.BSP/install
----

=== BSP Gotchas: Mismatching JVM versions

A common issue for poor performance can be a mismatch of the JVMs.
In such a case the Mill BSP server started by a BSP client like Metals is using a _different_ JVM than `mill` is using when started from the command line.
In such a scenario, every Mill invocation using the other JVM will inadvertently invalidate Mills  target caches.
This effectively leads to full reevaluation of all invoked Mill targets and appears as "bad performance".

To detect if this is the case,

1. import the project in the BSP client.
2. Wait until the BSP import process has finished.
3. Then run `mill __.compile` in the terminal.
4. Now watch the IDE, to see if the compile command invoked in the terminal has triggered compilation on the build server.

If this happens, you're using different JVMs.
Unfortunately, this is rather difficult to "defend" programmatically in Mill itself.
It is an explicit design goal of Mill, that it should work in different environments.
It is evident and likely unintentional that you have two conflicting local environments.

To fix this it's required to find where this difference stems from.
As a starting point,

* Find out which JVM is used for Mill on the CLi. `mill --version` reports its JVM.

* Search the `.bsp/mill-bsp.stderr` file for a line starting with `"Updating Evaluator"`.
It should contain all env variables (particularly `JAVA_HOME`) used by the BSP server.

Once you found and fixed that and the environments are the same, `clean` and restarting BSP should work as expected.


=== Using Bloop (standalone BSP server)

If you wish to use Bloop as your build server (it is the default metals BSP
implementation) with metals / vscode, consider using the mill bloop plugin.

xref:contrib/bloop.adoc[Bloop Plugin]

This is preferred to the instructions (currently) on the bloop website.

Please be aware, that the Bloop contrib plugin is maintained by the community
and is probably not on a par with the built-in BSP server.


=== IntelliJ IDEA Support

IntelliJ IDEA also supports the BSP protocol. To use this support, just follow
the directions in <<_build_server_protocol_bsp>>.

Additionally, you can generate IDEA project files directly with Mill.
This is probably the preferred way if you work on polyglot projects and need
support for other languages like Kotlin or AspectJ, which are currently not
specifically configured over BSP.

To generate IntelliJ IDEA project files into `.idea/`, run:

[source,bash]
----
mill mill.idea.GenIdea/idea
----

== Updating Mill

If you have installed Mill via the recommended <<_bootstrap_scripts,`Bootstrap Script`>>
method, you don't need to install multiple version of Mill explicitly.

Follow the next <<_overriding_mill_versions>> section for details.

== Overriding Mill Versions


Apart from downloading and installing new versions of Mill globally, there are
a few ways of selecting/updating your Mill version. This will only work, if you
have choosen one of the <<_bootstrap_scripts,Boostrap script methods>>:

* Create a `.mill-version` or `.config/mill-version` file to specify the version of Mill you wish to use:
[source,bash]
----
echo "0.5.0" > .mill-version
----

`.mill-version` takes precedence over `.config/mill-version` or the version of Mill specified in the `./mill` script.

* Pass in a `MILL_VERSION` environment variable, e.g.
[source,bash]
----
MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb mill __.compile
----

or

[source,bash]
----
MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb ./mill __.compile
----

to override the Mill version manually. This takes precedence over the version
specified in `./mill`, `.config/mill-version` or `.mill-version`

=== Automatic Mill updates

If your project is hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you can use
https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward[Scala Steward] to
automatically open a pull request to update your Mill version (in
`.mill-version` or `.config/mill-version` file), whenever there is a newer version available.

TIP: Scala Steward can also
xref:Scala_Module_Config.adoc#_keeping_up_to_date_with_scala_steward[scan your project dependencies]
and keep them up-to-date.

=== Development Releases

In case you want to try out the latest features and improvements that are
currently in the main branch, unstable versions of Mill
are
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/releases[available] as binaries named
`+#.#.#-n-hash+` linked to the latest tag.

The easiest way to use a development release is to use one of the
<<_bootstrap_scripts>>, which support <<_overriding_mill_versions>> via an
`MILL_VERSION` environment variable or a `.mill-version` or `.config/mill-version` file.
