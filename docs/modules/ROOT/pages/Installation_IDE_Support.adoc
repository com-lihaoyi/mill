= Installation and IDE Support
:page-aliases: Installation.adoc, IDE_Support.adoc

The best method of installing Mill is to just install a bootstrap script.
This script can determine the best version to be used by a project (e.g. by
reading a `.mill-version` file) and will use this exact Mill version.
If that version is not installed locally, it will be downloaded automatically.

== Bootstrap Scripts

There are currently two bootstrap script available, one
<<_mills_bootstrap_script_linuxos_x_only,in the Mill repository>>, which only
work for Linux and Unix-like machines, and one <<_millw,external `millw` script>>,
with more features and also Windows support.

Using `millw` is recommended.

We plan to merge both script in the future.

=== Mill's Bootstrap Script (Linux/OS-X Only)

If you are using Mill in a codebase, you can commit the bootstrap launcher as a
`./mill` script in the project folder:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
curl -L {mill-github-url}/releases/download/{mill-last-tag}/{mill-version} > mill && chmod +x mill
----

Now, anyone who wants to work with the project can simply use the `./mill`
script directly:

[source,bash]
----
./mill version
./mill __.compile # double underscore
----

The `mill` command will automatically use the version specified by the
bootstrap script, even if you installed it via other means. The `./mill` file
has a version number embedded within it, which you can update simply by editing
the script. Bootstrap scripts are also useful for running Mill in CI, ensuring
that your Jenkins/Travis/etc. box has the correct version of Mill present to
build/compile/test your code.

In general, bootstrap scripts are the recommended way of installing Mill
because they reduce the chance of errors due to the installed version of Mill
being incompatible with the version expected by your build.

=== millw

Instead of installing Mill directly, you can also use
https://github.com/lefou/millw[lefou/millw] as drop-in replacement for `mill`.
It provides a small shell script and also a Windows batch file, that
transparently downloads `mill` and executes it on your behalf. It respects
various ways to configure the preferred Mill version (`MILL_VERSION` env var,
`.mill-version` file, `--mill-version` option) and can also be used as a
bootstrap script in your project.


== Installing Mill Globally

While the <<_bootstrap_scripts>> approach above is the recommended way of
installing Mill for a project, you can also install Mill globally in your
operating system using the commands shown below.

=== OS X

Installation via https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/mill.rb[homebrew]:

[source,sh]
----
brew install mill

----

=== Arch Linux

Arch Linux has a https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/mill/[Community package for mill]:

[source,bash]
----
pacman -S mill

----

=== FreeBSD

Installation via http://man.freebsd.org/pkg/8[pkg(8)]:

[source,sh]
----
pkg install mill

----

=== Gentoo Linux

[source,sh]
----
emerge dev-java/mill-bin

----

=== Windows

To get started, download Mill from
{mill-github-url}/releases/download/{mill-last-tag}/{mill-last-tag}-assembly[Github releases], and save it as `mill.bat`.

If you're using https://scoop.sh[Scoop] you can install Mill via

[source,bash]
----
scoop install mill
----

=== WSL / MSYS2 / Cycgin / Git-Bash

Mill also works on "sh" environments on Windows (e.g.,
https://www.msys2.org[MSYS2],
https://www.cygwin.com[Cygwin],
https://gitforwindows.org[Git-Bash],
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl[WSL]); to get started, follow the instructions in the <<_manual>>
section. Note that:

* In some environments (such as WSL), Mill might have to be run without a server (using `-i`, `--interactive`, `--no-server`, or `--repl`.)

* On Cygwin, run the following after downloading mill:

[source,bash]
----
sed -i '0,/-cp "\$0"/{s/-cp "\$0"/-cp `cygpath -w "\$0"`/}; 0,/-cp "\$0"/{s/-cp "\$0"/-cp `cygpath -w "\$0"`/}' /usr/local/bin/mill
----

=== Docker

You can download and run
a https://hub.docker.com/r/nightscape/scala-mill/["Docker image containing OpenJDK, Scala and Mill"] using

[source,bash]
----
docker pull nightscape/scala-mill
docker run -it nightscape/scala-mill
----

=== Manual

To get started, download Mill and install it into your HOME ".local/bin" via the following
`curl`/`chmod` command:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
sh -c "curl -L {mill-github-url}/releases/download/{mill-last-tag}/{mill-last-tag} > ~/.local/bin/mill && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/mill"
----

=== Coursier (unsupported)

Installing mill via `coursier` or `cs` is currently not officially supported.
There are various issues, especially with interactive mode.

== IDE Support
:link-metals: https://scalameta.org/metals/

To support various IDEs and Language Servers, Mill supports the
https://build-server-protocol.github.io/[Build Server Protocol] in version
{bsp-version} and has a <<Build Server Protocol (BSP),built-in BSP server>>.

In addition to BSP, Mill also supports
<<IntelliJ IDEA Support,IntelliJ IDEA project configuration generation>>
directly.


=== Build Server Protocol (BSP)

The Build Server Protocol has the concept of BSP server discovery, which means:
A BSP client can connect to any BSP server, as long as there is a connection
file under the `.bsp/` directory.

To install a BSP connection file `.bsp/mill-bsp.json` for Mill, run:

[source,bash]
----
mill mill.bsp.BSP/install
----

Working known clients of the BSP server are IntelliJ IDEA and {link-metals}[Metals].

You can fine control some BSP server options by specifying command options:

|===
| Option | Description
|`--jobs` `n` | Use `n` threads in parallel to run tasks. A value of `0` means
to use as many threads as the system has cpu cores.
|===


[source]

[NOTE]
--
*Using Metals*

When using Metals by default Bloop will be used as your build server unless
you explicitly choose Mill. When in a Mill workspace use the "Switch Build
Server" command from Metals which will allow you to switch to using Mill as
your build server. If no `.bsp/mill-bsp.json` file exists, Metals will
automatically create it for you and then connect to Mill.

Metals is relying on SemanticDB to enable many of its features.
Mill BSP now also supports to provide this SemanticDB data, when the BSP client
(like Metals) requests it.

As of writing this, Metals 0.11.8 is the latest available version, which is not
able to detect the fact, that Mill _is_ already providing SemanticDB data. As a
consequence, it reports missing SemanticDB data, although some SemanticDB-based
features are already working. This may be fixed eventually in a future release of Metals.
--

[CAUTION]
--
*Updating older setups*

In the past, we provided SemanticDB support via `mill.scalalib.bsp.ScalaMetalsSupport`
trait, which had to be mixed-in to your Scala modules. This is no longer needed and
deprecated. You should remove these mix-ins.
`ScalaMetalsSupport` trait is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.
--

=== If things go wrong

In case things go wrong, it can be sometimes hard to find the cause.
BSP is just a protocol, and as such, issues on the server side (the Mill BSP
server) might not well propagated to the BSP client (your IDE).

For that reason Mill BSP server is writing a log file under
`.bsp/mill-bsp.stderr`, where you can find various information about what's
going on. Its content should look familiar, as it contains regular Mill
output accompanied by additional BSP client-server communication details.

You can increase the verbosity of that log file, when you run Mill with
`--debug` at installation time (of the BSP discovery file).

[source,bash]
----
mill --debug mill.bsp.BSP/install
----


=== Using Bloop (standalone BSP server)

If you wish to use Bloop as your build server (it is the default metals BSP
implementation) with metals / vscode, consider using the mill bloop plugin.

xref:contrib/bloop.adoc[Bloop Plugin]

This is preferred to the instructions (currently) on the bloop website.

Please be aware, that the Bloop contrib plugin is maintained by the community
and is probably not on a par with the built-in BSP server.


=== IntelliJ IDEA Support

IntelliJ IDEA also supports the BSP protocol. To use this support, just follow
the directions in <<_build_server_protocol_bsp>>.

Additionally, you can generate IDEA project files directly with Mill.
This is probably the preferred way if you work on polyglot projects and need
support for other languages like Kotlin or AspectJ, which are currently not
specifically configured over BSP.

To generate IntelliJ IDEA project files into `.idea/`, run:

[source,bash]
----
mill mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea
----

== Updating Mill

If you have installed Mill via the recommended <<_bootstrap_scripts,`Bootstrap Script`>>
method, you don't need to install multiple version of Mill explicitly.

Follow the next <<_overriding_mill_versions>> section for details.

== Overriding Mill Versions


Apart from downloading and installing new versions of Mill globally, there are
a few ways of selecting/updating your Mill version. This will only work, if you
have choosen one of the <<_bootstrap_scripts,Boostrap script methods>>:

* Create a `.mill-version` file to specify the version of Mill you wish to use:
[source,bash]
----
echo "0.5.0" > .mill-version
----

`.mill-version` takes precedence over the version of Mill specified in the
`./mill` script.

* Pass in a `MILL_VERSION` environment variable, e.g.
[source,bash]
----
MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb mill __.compile
----

or

[source,bash]
----
MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb ./mill __.compile
----

to override the Mill version manually. This takes precedence over the version
specified in `./mill` or `.mill-version`

=== Automatic Mill updates

If your project is hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you can use
https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward[Scala Steward] to
automatically open a pull request to update your Mill version (in
`.mill-version` file), whenever there is a newer version available.

TIP: Scala Steward can also
xref:Configuration.adoc#_keeping_up_to_date_with_scala_steward[scan your project dependencies]
and keep them up-to-date.

=== Development Releases

In case you want to try out the latest features and improvements that are
currently in the main branch, unstable versions of Mill
are
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/releases[available] as binaries named
`+#.#.#-n-hash+` linked to the latest tag.

The easiest way to use a development release is to use one of the
<<_bootstrap_scripts>>, which support <<_overriding_mill_versions>> via an
`MILL_VERSION` environment variable or a `.mill-version` file.
