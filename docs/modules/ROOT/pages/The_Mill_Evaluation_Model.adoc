= The Mill Evaluation Model

Evaluating a Mill target typically goes through the following phases:

1. *Compilation*: Mill compiles the `build.sc` to classfiles, following the
<<_the_mill_bootstrapping_process>> to eventually produce a `RootModule` object

2. *Planning*: Mill resolves the list of xref:Tasks.adoc[] given from the command line,
   e.g. `resolve _` or `foo.compile` or `{bar,qux}.__.test`, to a list of
   concrete `Task` objects nested on xref:Modules.adoc[] within the `RootModule` along
   with their transitive dependencies

    * In the process, the relevant Mill ``Module``s  are lazily instantiated

3. *Evaluation*: Mill evaluates the gathered ``Task``s in dependency-order,
    either serially or in parallel

== Limitations of the Mill Evaluation Model

This three-phase evaluation model has consequences for how you structure your
build. For example:

1. You can have arbitrary code outside of ``Task``s that helps
   set up your task graph and module hierarchy, e.g. computing what keys exist
   in a `Cross` module, or specifying your `def moduleDeps`

2. You can have arbitrary code inside of ``Task``s, to perform your build
   actions

3. *But* your code inside of ``Task``s cannot influence the shape of the task
   graph or module hierarchy, as all *Resolving* and *Planning* happens first
   *before* any ``Task``s are evaluated.

This should not be a problem for most builds, but it is something to be aware
of. In general, we have found that having "two places" to put code - outside of
``Task``s to run during *Planning* or inside of ``Task``s to run during
*Evaluation* - is generally enough flexibility for most use cases.

The hard boundary between these two phases is what lets users easily query
and visualize their module hierarchy and task graph without running them: using
xref:Builtin_Commands.adoc#inspect[inspect], xref:Builtin_Commands.adoc#plan[plan],
xref:Builtin_Commands.adoc#_visualize[visualize], etc.. This helps keep your
Mill build discoverable even as the `build.sc` codebase grows.

== Caching at Each Layer of the Evaluation Model

Apart from fine-grained caching of ``Task``s during *Evaluation*, Mill also
performs incremental evaluation of the other phases. This helps ensure
the overall workflow remains fast even for large projects:

1. *Compilation*:

    * Done on-demand and incrementally using the Scala
      incremental compiler https://github.com/sbt/zinc[Zinc].

    * If some of the files `build.sc` imported changed but not others, only the
      changed files are re-compiled before the `RootModule` is re-instantiated

    * In the common case where `build.sc` was not changed at all, this step is
      skipped entirely and the `RootModule` object simply re-used from the last
      run.

2. *Planning*:

    * If the `RootModule` was re-used, then all
      previously-instantiated modules are simply-re-used

3. *Evaluation*:

    * ``Task``s are evaluated in dependency order

    * xref:Tasks.adoc#_targets[Target]s only re-evaluate if their input ``Task``s
     change.

    * xref:Tasks.adoc#_persistent_targets[T.persistent]s preserve the `T.dest` folder on disk between runs,
      allowing for finer-grained caching than Mill's default target-by-target
      caching and invalidation

    * xref:Tasks.adoc#_workers[T.worker]s are kept in-memory between runs where possible, and only
      invalidated if their input ``Task``s change as well.

    * ``Task``s in general are invalidated if the code they depend on changes;
      e.g. if `build.sc` imports `helper.sc`, then a change in `build.sc` would
      invalidate all tasks in `build.sc`, but not those in `helper.sc`

This approach to caching does assume a certain programming style inside your
`build.sc`: we may or may not re-instantiate the `RootModule` of your
`build.sc` depending on caching, and your code should work either way. For code
written in a typical Scala style, this is not a problem at all.

One thing to note is for code that runs during *Planning*: any reading of
external mutable state needs to be wrapped in an `interp.watchValue{...}`
wrapper. This ensures that Mill knows where these external reads are, so that
it can check if their value changed and if so re-instantiate `RootModule` with
the new value.

== The Mill Bootstrapping Process

Mill's bootstrapping proceeds roughly in the following phases:

1. If using the bootstrap script, it first checks if the right version of Mill
is already present, and if not it downloads it to `~/.mill/download`

2. It instantiates an in-memory `MillBuildRootModule.BootstrapModule`,
which is a hard-coded `build.sc` used for bootstrapping Mill

3. If there is a meta-build present `mill-build/build.sc`, it processes that
first and uses the `MillBuildRootModule` returned for the next steps.
Otherwise it uses the `MillBuildRootModule.BootstrapModule` directly

4. Mill evaluates the `MillBuildRootModule` to parse the `build.sc`, generate
a list of `ivyDeps` as well as appropriately wrapped Scala code that we can
compile, and compiles it to classfiles

5. Mill loads the compiled classfiles of the `build.sc` into a
`java.lang.ClassLoader` to access it's `RootModule`

Everything earlier in the doc applies to each level of meta-builds in the
Mill bootstrapping process as well.

In general, `.sc` files, `import $file`, and `import $ivy` can be thought of as
a short-hand for configuring the meta-build living in `mill-build/build.sc`:

1. `.sc` and `import $file` are a shorthand for specifying the `.scala` files
   living in `mill-build/src/`

2. `import $ivy` is a short-hand for configurin the `def ivyDeps` in
   `mill-build/build.sc`

Most builds would not need the flexibility of a meta-build's
`mill-build/build.sc`, but it is there if necessary.

Mill supports multiple levels of meta-builds for bootstrapping:

- Just `build.sc`
- One level of meta-builds: `mill-build/build.sc` and `build.sc`
- Two level of meta-builds: `mill-build/mill-build/build.sc`,
  `mill-build/build.sc` and `build.sc`

xref:Extending_Mill.adoc#_the_mill_meta_build[Extending Mill: The Mill Meta Build] works through a simple use case
and example for meta-builds.
