= Installation & IDE Support

The standard method of installing Mill is to install a `./mill` <<_bootstrap_scripts,bootstrap script>>,
similar to `./gradlew` or `./mvnw` in other build tools.
This script can determine the best version to be used by a project (e.g. by
reading a `.mill-version`) and will use this exact Mill version.
If the determined Mill version is not installed locally, it will be downloaded automatically.

For all the examples in this documentation, there is a `download` link that provides
a zip file containing the full example ready to use. These examples come with a `./mill`
script you can use to immediately begin working with the project, needing only a JVM installed
globally.

[#_bootstrap_scripts]
== Bootstrap Scripts

Although the Mill example projects come with their own `./mill` bootstrap script,
you can also download it manually:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
curl -L {mill-github-url}/releases/download/{mill-last-tag}/{mill-last-tag} > mill && chmod +x mill
echo {mill-last-tag} > .mill-version
----

Downloading a `mill` bootstrap script to the root of your project repository helps make it easier for
new contributors to build your project, as they don't have to install Mill before they can start.
Anyone who wants to work with the project can simply use the `./mill` script directly.

[source,bash]
----
./mill --version
./mill __.compile # double underscore
----


In general, bootstrap scripts are the recommended way of installing Mill.
Similar to `./gradlew` or `./mvnw`, the `./mill` bootstrap script
reduces the chance of errors due to the installed version of Mill
being incompatible with the version expected by your build.
In-project bootstrap scripts are also useful for running Mill in CI/CD, ensuring
that your build server like Jenkins or Github Actions has the correct version of Mill
present to build, compile or test your code.

If you are starting a new project using a Mill bootstrap script, you can use the
xref:javalib/builtin-commands.adoc#_init[mill init] to initialize the project
folder with one of the Mill example projects. There are a wide range of example projects,
from hello-world to multi-module libraries to client-server web applications, and you can
pick one most similar to what you are doing so you can hit the ground running working.

=== Windows

If you are running on Windows, you should use https://github.com/lefou/millw[lefou/millw]
as a drop-in replacement for `./mill` that supports running on all major platforms including MS Windows.

`./millw` will likely be merged into `./mill` in the near future.

== IDE Support

:link-metals: https://scalameta.org/metals/

Mill supports IntelliJ and VSCode, both via the standard
https://build-server-protocol.github.io/[Build Server Protocol]

=== IntelliJ

To use Mill with IntelliJ, first ensure you have the free
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-scala[IntelliJ Scala Plugin]
installed. This is necessary as Mill build files are written in Scala,
even if you are using it to build a Java or Kotlin project.

Once you have the plugin installed, you can use IntelliJ to open any project
containing a Mill `build.mill` file, and IntelliJ will automatically load the
Mill build. If you have multiple build systems installed, Intellij may give you
choice which build system configuration to use for the import, which case select `BSP`:

image::basic/IntellijSelectBsp.png[]



This will provide support both for your application code,
as well as the code in the `build.mill`:

image::basic/IntellijApp.png[]

image::basic/IntellijBuild.png[]

If IntelliJ does not highlight the `.mill` files correctly, you can explicitly enable
it by adding `*.mill` to the `Scala` file type:

image::basic/IntellijFileTypeConfig.png[]

If you make changes to your Mill `build.mill`, you can ask Intellij to load
those updates by opening the "BSP" tab and clicking the "Refresh" button

image::basic/IntellijRefresh.png[]

==== IntelliJ IDEA XML Support

Apart from using the Build Server Protocol, you can also generate IDEA project
files directly with Mill. This is probably the preferred way if you work on
polyglot projects and need support for frameworks like AspectJ,
which are currently not specifically configured over BSP.

To generate IntelliJ IDEA project files into `.idea/`, run:

[source,bash]
----
./mill mill.idea.GenIdea/
----

This will generate the XML files IntelliJ uses to configure your project

```
.idea
.idea/scala_settings.xml
.idea/mill_modules
.idea/mill_modules/.iml
.idea/mill_modules/mill-build.iml
.idea/mill_modules/test.iml
.idea/libraries
.idea/libraries/mill_scalalib_2_13_0_11_10_jar.xml
...
.idea/workspace.xml
.idea/modules.xml
.idea/scala_compiler.xml
.idea/misc.xml
```

After the files are generated, you can open the folder in IntelliJ to load the project
into your IDE. If you make changes to your Mill `build.mill`, you can update the project config
those updates by running `./mill mill.idea.GenIdea/` again.

=== VSCode

To use Mill with VSCode, first ensure you have the free
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals[Metals VSCode Scala language server]
installed. This is necessary as Mill build files are written in Scala,
even if you are using it to build a Java project.

NOTE: Mill in VSCode only supports Java and Scala. Kotlin users should use IntelliJ

Once you have the language server installed, you can ask VSCode to open any folder
containing a Mill `build.mill` file, and VSCode will ask you to import your
Mill build. This will provide support both for your application code,
as well as the code in the `build.mill`:

image::basic/VSCodeApp.png[]

image::basic/VSCodeBuild.png[]

If you make changes to your Mill `build.mill`, you can ask VSCode to load
those updates by opening the "BSP" tab and clicking the "Refresh" button

image::basic/VSCodeRefresh.png[]

=== Debugging IDE issues

Mill's BSP IDE integration writes to a log file under
`.bsp/mill-bsp.stderr`, where you can find various information about what's
going on. It contains regular Mill output accompanied by additional BSP
client-server communication details. This can be useful to look at if your
IDE fails to import your Mill project

== Updating Mill

Typically, most Mill projects use a `.mill-version` file to configure what version
to use. You can update the version specified in this file in order to change the version
of Mill. The file path `.config/mill-version` is also supported. If neither is provided,
the `./mill` bootstrap script will use the `DEFAULT_MILL_VERSION` it has built in.

To choose a different Mill version on an ad-hoc basis, e.g. for experimentation, you can pass
in a `MILL_VERSION` environment variable, e.g.

[source,bash]
----
MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb mill __.compile
----

or

[source,bash]
----
MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb ./mill __.compile
----

to override the Mill version manually. This takes precedence over the version
specified in `./mill`, `.config/mill-version` or `.mill-version`

== Working without access to Maven Central

Under some circumstances (e.g. corporate firewalls), you may not have access maven central.
The typical symptom will be error messages which look like this;

----
1 tasks failed
mill.scalalib.ZincWorkerModule.classpath
Resolution failed for 1 modules:
--------------------------------------------
  com.lihaoyi:mill-scalalib-worker_2.13:0.11.1
        not found: C:\Users\partens\.ivy2\local\com.lihaoyi\mill-scalalib-worker_2.13\0.11.1\ivys\ivy.xml
        download error: Caught java.io.IOException (Server returned HTTP response code: 503 for URL: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/lihaoyi/mill-scalalib-worker_2.13/0.11.1/mill-scalalib-worker_2.13-0.11.1.pom) while downloading https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/lihaoyi/mill-scalalib-worker_2.13/0.11.1/mill-scalalib-worker_2.13-0.11.1.pom
----

It is expected that basic commands (e.g. clean) will not work, as Mill saying it is
unable to resolve it's own, fundamental, dependencies. Under such circumstances, you
will normally have access to some proxy, or other corporate repository which resolves
maven artifacts. The strategy is simply to tell mill to use that instead.

The idea is to set an environment variable COURSIER_REPOSITORIES (see coursier docs).
The below command should pass the environment variable to the `mill` command.

----
 COURSIER_REPOSITORIES=https://packages.corp.com/artifactory/maven/ mill resolve _
----

If you are using bootstrap script, a more permanent solution could be to set the environment variable
at the top of the bootstrap script, or as a user environment variable etc.



== Automatic Mill updates

If your project is hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you can use
https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward[Scala Steward] to
automatically open a pull request to update your Mill version (in
`.mill-version` or `.config/mill-version` file), whenever there is a newer version available.

TIP: Scala Steward can also
xref:scalalib/dependencies.adoc#_keeping_up_to_date_with_scala_steward[scan your project dependencies]
and keep them up-to-date.

== Development Releases

In case you want to try out the latest features and improvements that are
currently in the main branch, unstable versions of Mill
are
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/releases[available] as binaries named
`+#.#.#-n-hash+` linked to the latest tag.

The easiest way to use a development release is to use one of the
<<_bootstrap_scripts>>, which support overriding Mill versions via an
`MILL_VERSION` environment variable or a `.mill-version` or `.config/mill-version` file.
