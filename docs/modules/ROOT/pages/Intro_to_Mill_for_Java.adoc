// Author Notes:
//
// This is the first page a user is expected to land on when learning about
// Mill. It is designed to be a quick, broad overview to get someone started:
// what is Mill, why should they care, and what some simple Mill builds look
// like and how to use them. We intentionally touch shallowly on a lot of
// topics without giving them a proper discussion, since the other pages have
// plenty of space to go in-depth.
//
// By the end of this page, a prospective Mill user should be familiar with
// what Mill is, hopefully have downloaded an example to try out, and be
// interested in learning more about the Mill build tool

= Introduction to Mill for Java


{mill-github-url}[Mill] is your shiny new Java build tool! Mill aims for
simplicity by reusing concepts you are already familiar with, borrowing ideas
from modern tools like https://maven.apache.org/[Maven], https://gradle.org/[Gradle],
https://bazel.build/[Bazel]. Mill lets you build and customize
your projects in a way that's simple, fast, and predictable.

Mill automates dealing with a lot of common build-tool concerns such as caching,
incremental re-computation, and parallelism. This allows you
to focus your effort on the business logic unique to your build, while letting
Mill take care of all the rest. Mill's caching and parallelism mean it scales well
from small projects to large codebases with hundreds of modules.

Compared to Maven and Gradle, Mill builds are far more intuitive and easy to read,
write, and debug:

* **Mill builds are an order of magnitude more concise than Maven pom.xml files**: this makes
  them both easy to write and easy to read at a glance
