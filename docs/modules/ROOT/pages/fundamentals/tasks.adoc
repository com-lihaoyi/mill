One of Mill's core abstractions is its _Task Graph_: this is how Mill defines,
orders and caches work it needs to do, and exists independently of any support
for building Java, Kotlin, or Scala.

Mill task graphs are primarily built using methods and macros defined on
`mill.define.Task`, aliased as `T` for conciseness:
