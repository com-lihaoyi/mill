= Contrib Plugins
:page-aliases: Contrib_Modules.adoc

The ((plugins)) in this section are hosted in the Mill git tree and developed / maintained by the community.

For details about including plugins in your `build.sc` read xref:Using_Plugins.adoc[Using Mill Plugins].

[CAUTION]
--
When using one of these contribution modules, it is important that the versions you load match your mill version.
To facilitate this, Mill will automatically replace the `$MILL_VERSION` literal in your ivy imports with the correct value.
You can also leave the version completely empty to default to the mill version (but don't forget to keep the trailing colon).

For instance:

[source,scala]
----
import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-bloop:$MILL_VERSION`
----

or

[source,scala]
----
import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-bloop:`
----
