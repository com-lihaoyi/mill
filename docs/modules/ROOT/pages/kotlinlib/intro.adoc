// Author Notes:
//
// This is the first page a user is expected to land on when learning about
// Mill. It is designed to be a quick, broad overview to get someone started:
// what is Mill, why should they care, and what some simple Mill builds look
// like and how to use them. We intentionally touch shallowly on a lot of
// topics without giving them a proper discussion, since the other pages have
// plenty of space to go in-depth.
//
// By the end of this page, a prospective Mill user should be familiar with
// what Mill is, hopefully have downloaded an example to try out, and be
// interested in learning more about the Mill build tool

NOTE: *Kotlin support in Mill is experimental*! A lot of stuff works, which is
documented under this section, but a lot of stuff doesn't. In particular,
support for Android, KotlinJS and Kotlin-Multi-Platform is still in its infancy.
The API is not yet stable and may evolve. Try it out but please be aware of its
limitations!

Mill's Kotlin support originated as the third-party plugin
https://github.com/lefou/mill-kotlin[lefou/mill-kotlin], which was later included with
the main Mill codebase under its https://github.com/lefou/mill-kotlin/blob/main/LICENSE[Apache 2.0 License].
