= Tasks

One of Mill's core abstractions is its _Task Graph_: this is how Mill defines,
orders and caches work it needs to do, and exists independently of any support
for building Scala.

Mill target graphs are primarily built using methods and macros defined on
`mill.define.Target`, aliased as `T` for conciseness:

== Task Cheat Sheet

The following table might help you make sense of the small collection of
different Task types:

[cols="<,<,<,<,<,<,<"]
|===
| |Target |Command |Source/Input |Anonymous Task |Persistent Target |Worker

|Cached to Disk |X | | | |X |
|JSON Writable |X |X |X| |X |
|JSON Readable |X | | | |X |
|CLI Runnable |X |X | | |X |
|Takes Arguments | |X | |X | |
|Cached In-Memory | | | | | |X
