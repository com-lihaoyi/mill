This section walks through Mill features and techniques used for managing large builds.
While Mill works great for small single-module projects, it is also able to work
effectively with large projects with hundreds of modules. Mill's own build for the
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill[com-lihaoyi/mill] project has ~400 modules, and
other proprietary projects may have many more.

Mill modules are cheap: having more modules does not significantly impact performance
or resource usage, so you are encouraged to break up your project into modules to manage
the layering of your codebase or benefit from parallelism.
