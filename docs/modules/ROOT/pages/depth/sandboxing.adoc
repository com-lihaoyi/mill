== Limitations

Mill's approach to filesystem sandboxing is designed to avoid accidental interference
between different Mill tasks. It is not designed to block intentional misbehavior, and
tasks are always able to traverse the filesystem and do whatever they want. Furthermore,
Mill's redirection of `os.pwd` does not apply to `java.io` or `java.nio` APIs, which are
outside of Mill's control.

However, by setting `os.pwd` to safe sandbox folders, we hope to minimize the cases where
someone accidentally causes issues with their build by doing the wrong thing.
