= The Mill Process Architecture

include::partial$gtag-config.adoc[]

This page goes into detail of how the Mill process and application is structured.
At a high-level, a simplified version of the main components and data-flows within
a running Mill process is shown below:

          "foo.classPath"
        }
      }

    }
  }


  "runArgs" -> "MillServerMain"
  "MillServerMain" -> "Evaluator" [dir=both]
  "ServerSocket" -> "PromptLogger" [dir=back]
  "exitCode" -> "MillServerMain" [dir=back]
  "MillClientMain" -> "exitCode" [dir=back]

  "compile.json" -> "foo.compile"  [dir=both]

}
```


== The Mill Client

The Mill client is a small Java application that is responsible for launching
and delegating work to the Mill server, a long-lived process. Each `./mill`
command spawns a new Mill client, but generally re-uses the same Mill server where
possible in order to reduce startup overhead and to allow the Mill server
process to warm up and provide good performance

* The Mill client takes all the inputs of a typical command-line application -
stdin and command-line arguments - and proxies them to the long-lived Mill
server process.

* It then takes the outputs from the Mill server - stdout, stderr,
and finally the exitcode - and proxies those back to the calling process or terminal.

In this way, the Mill client acts and behaves for most all intents and purposes
as a normal CLI application, except it is really a thin wrapper around logic that
is actually running in the long-lived Mill server.

The Mill server sometimes is shut down and needs to be restarted, e.g. if Mill
version changed, or the user used `Ctrl-C` to interrupt the ongoing computation.
In such a scenario, the Mill client will automatically restart the server the next
time it is run, so apart from a slight performance penalty from starting a "cold"
Mill server such shutdowns and restarts should be mostly invisibl to the user.

== The Mill Server

The Mill server is a long-lived process that the Mill client spawns.
Only one Mill server should be running in a codebase at a time, and each server
takes a filelock at startup time to enforce this mutual exclusion.

The Mill server compiles your `build.mill` and `package.mill`, spawns a
`URLClassLoader` containing the compiled classfiles, and uses that to instantiate
the variousxref:fundamentals/modules.adoc[] and xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc[]
dynamically in-memory. These are then used by the `Evaluator`, which resolves,
plans, and executes the tasks specified by the given `runArgs`

During execution, both standard output
and standard error are captured during evaluation and forwarded to the `PromptLogger`.
`PromptLogger` annotates the output stream with the line-prefixes, prompt, and ANSI
terminal commands necessary to generate the dynamic prompt, and then forwards both
streams multi-plexed over a single socket stream back to the Mill client. The client
then de-multiplexes the combined stream to split it back into output and error, which
are then both forwarded to the process or terminal that invoked the Mill client.

Lastly, when the Mill server completes its tasks, it writes the `exitCode` to a file
that is then propagated back to the Mill client. The Mill client terminates with this
exit code, but the Mill server remains alive and ready to serve to the next Mill
client that connects to it

For a more detailed discussion of what exactly goes into "execution", see
xref:depth/execution-model.adoc[].


== The Out Folder

The `out/` directory is where most of Mill's state lives on disk, both build-task state
such as the `foo/compile.json` metadata cache for `foo.compile`, or the `foo/compile.dest`
which stores any generated files or binaries. It also contains `mill-server/` folder which
is used to pass data back and forth between the client and server: the `runArgs`, `exitCode`,
etc.

Each task during evaluation reads and writes from its own designated paths in the `out/`
folder. Each task's files are not touched by any other tasks, nor are they used in the rest
of the Mill architecture: they are solely meant to serve each task's caching and filesystem
needs.

More documentation on what the `out/` directory contains and how to make use of it can be
found at xref:fundamentals/out-dir.adoc[].
