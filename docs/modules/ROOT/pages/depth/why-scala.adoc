= Why does Mill use Scala?

include::partial$gtag-config.adoc[]

One question that comes up a lot among Mill users is why use Scala as the language
to configure your build? Why not YAML, XML, TOML, Bash, Groovy, Python, Java, or any of the
other hundred programming and configuration languages in widespread use today? Scala
is definitely a niche language, but it also has some unique properties that make it
especially suitable to be used for configuring the build system of a small or large project.

For the purposes of this page, we will break down this topic into three top-level questions: why
Mill uses a _general-purpose programming language_, why Mill uses
the _Scala_ Language, and why Mill wants to run on the _Java Virtual Machine_

== Why a General Purpose Language?

While Mill uses a general-purpose programming language (Scala), many build tools use
restricted config languages instead, or their own custom tool-specific languages. Why
that is the case is an interesting discussion.

=== Why Not Config Languages?

Many build tools use restricted config languages rather than a general-purpose language:

|===
| Language | Tool
| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML[XML] | https://maven.apache.org/[Maven], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSBuild[MSBuild], https://ant.apache.org/[Ant]
| https://toml.io/en/[TOML] | https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/[pyproject.toml], https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/[Cargo], https://python-poetry.org/[Poetry]
| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON[JSON] | https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json/[NPM]
| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML[YAML] | https://bleep.build/docs/[Bleep]
|===

At a first glance, using a restricted language is tempting: restricted languages _are_
simpler than general purpose languages, with less complexity. However, build systems
are often fundamentally complex systems, especially as codebases or organizations grow.
Often projects find themselves with custom build system requirements that do not fit nicely
into these "simple metadata formats":

* Code generation: https://protobuf.dev/[protobuf], https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI/Swagger], https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26217488/what-is-vendoring[vendoring code], etc.
* Resource generation: static resource pipelines, version metadata, https://www.cisa.gov/sbom[SBOM]s, etc.
* Deployment workflows: https://www.docker.com/[docker], https://kubernetes.io/[kubernetes], https://aws.amazon.com/[AWS], etc.

While most "common" workflows in "common" build tools will have _some_ built in support
or plugin, it may not do exactly what you need, the plugin may be unmaintained, or you
may hit some requirement unique to your business.
When using a restricted config language to configure your build, and you hit one of these
unusual requirements, there are usually four outcomes:

1. Find some third-party "plugin" (and these build systems always have plugins!) written
   in a general-purpose language to use in your XML/TOML/JSON file, or write your own plugin
   if none of the off-the-shelve plugins exactly match your requirements (which is very likely!)

2. Have your build tool delegate the logic to some "run bash script" step, and implement your
   custom logic in the bash script that the build tool wraps

3. Take the build tool and wrap _it_ in a bash script, that implements the custom logic and
   configures the build tool dynamically on the fly by generating XML/TOML/JSON files or
   passing environment variables or properties

4. Extend your XML/TOML/JSON config language with general-purpose programming language
   features: conditionals, variables, functions, etc. (see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/evaluate-expressions-in-workflows-and-actions[Github Config Expressions],
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference.html[AWS Cloudformation Functions],
   https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/templates/[Helm Chart Templating])

Anyone who has been in industry for some time has likely seen all of these outcomes at various
companies and in various codebases. The fundamental issue is that _build systems are inherently
complex_, and if your built tool _language_ does not accommodate that complexity, the complexity
ends up leaking elsewhere outside the purview of the build tool.

Mill's choice of using a general purpose language does mean more complexity in the core
language or build tool, but it also allows you to _move complexity into the build tool_
rather than having it live in third-party plugins, ad-hoc bash scripts, or weird pseudo-languages
embedded in your config. A general-purpose language likely has better IDE integration,
tooling, safety, performance, and ecosystem support than bash scripts or
embedded-pseudo-config-languages, and if your build system complexity has to live _somewhere_,
it's better to write it in a general-purpose language where it can be properly managed,
as long as a suitable general-purpose language can be found.

=== Why Not A Custom Language?

Many build tools do use custom languages:

- https://cmake.org/[CMake]
- https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/[Autoconf]
- https://earthly.dev/[Earthly]
- https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[Make]

The basic issue with custom languages is that although they may in theory match your
build tool requirements perfectly, they lack in all other areas that a widely-used
general-purpose language does well:

- IDE support in all popular IDEs and editors
- Library ecosystem of publicly available helpers and plugins
- Package publishing and distribution infrastructure
- Tooling: debuggers, profilers
- _Quality_ of the language itself: things like type systems, basic syntax, standard library,
  error messages, etc.

A custom tool-specific language implemented in a few person-months will definitely be
much less polished in all these areas that a widely-used general-purpose language that
has been gradually improved upon for a decade or two. While in theory a custom language could
catch up with enough staffing to implement all these features, in practice even projects
like https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[Make] that are used for decades fall behind niche
general-purpose languages when it comes to the supporting ecosystem above. As an example,
how do you publish a re-usable makefile that others can depend on and adjust to fit their
requirements? And how is the IDE experience of navigating around large `Makefiles`?

Using a general-purpose language to configure a build tool provides all these things
out of the box. Provided, again, that a suitable language can be found!


== Why the Scala Language?
=== Conciseness

A build language has to be concise; although Java and C++ are popular and widely used,
you rarely see people writing their build logic in Java or C++
(with https://rife2.com/bld[some exceptions]), and even XML is pretty rare these days
(with https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] being the notable exception). Programming and Configuration language
verbosity is a spectrum, and the languages used to configure the build are typically
in the less-verbose end of the spectrum:

|===
| Language | Tool
| https://www.python.org/[Python] (or https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark[StarLark]) | https://bazel.build/[Bazel], https://www.pantsbuild.org/[Pants], https://buck.build/[Buck], https://scons.org/[Scons]
| https://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] | https://gradle.org/[Gradle]
| https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby]  | https://github.com/ruby/rake[Rake]
| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript[Javascript]  | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunt_(software)[Grunt], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulp.js[Gulp], etc.
|===

While some tools go even more concise (e.g. Bash, Make, etc.), typically this
Python/Groovy/Ruby/TOML/YAML level of conciseness is where most build tools end up.

Given that, Scala fits right in: it is neither too verbose (like Java/C++/XML), nor is
it as terse as the syntaxes of Bash or Make. Mill's bundled libraries like
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/requests-scala[Requests-Scala] or
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/os-lib[OS-Lib], they would not look out of place in any
Python or Ruby codebase. Scala's balance between conciseness and verbosity is
more or less what we want when configuring a build.

=== Static Typing

Scala is a statically typed language. That has many consequences: good performance,
powerful linting frameworks (e.g. https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/[Scalafix]),
good toolability, and protection against many classes of "dumb bugs".

For a build tool like Mill, perhaps what matters most is:
_toolability_ and _protection against dumb bugs_.

Most developers using a build tool are
not build tool experts, and have no desire to become build tool experts. They will
forever be cargo-culting examples they find online, copy-pasting from other parts of the
codebase, or blindly fumbling their customizations. It is in this
context that Mill's static typing really shines: what such "perpetual beginners" need
most is help understanding/navigating the build logic, and help checking their
proposed changes for dumb mistakes. And there will be dumb mistakes, because most
people are not and will never be build-tool experts or enthusiasts

To that end, Mill's static typing gives it a big advantage here. It's IDE support
is much better xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[compared to Maven] or
xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[compared to Gradle], and that is largely due to the
way Scala's static types give the IDE more to work with than more dynamic languages.
And, while Scala's static typing won't catch every subtle bug, it does do a good job
at catching the dumb bugs that non-experts will typically make when configuring their
build system

Almost every programming language these days is statically typed to some degree,
Python has https://github.com/python/mypy[MyPy], Ruby has https://sorbet.org/[Sorbet],
Javascript has https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript], and so on. But
Scala has static typing built deeply into the core of the language, and so it works
more smoothly than other languages which have static typing bolted on after-the-fact:
The syntax is slicker, the IDEs work better, the error reporting is friendlier.
And that's why Scala's static typing really shines when used in Mill builds even
for non-experts with no prior background in Scala.

=== Functional and Object-Oriented Features

Scala is perhaps the language that sits most squarely on the fence between functional
and object-oriented programming:

* It provides functional features from basic first-class functions immutability,
  all the way to more advanced techniques like Typeclasses

* It also provides object oriented features, again from basic classes and overrides
  to more advanced mixin trait composition and implicit conversions

Mill makes heavy use of both the functional and object-oriented features of the Scala
language. As discussed in the section on xref:depth/design-principles.adoc[Mill Design Principles],
Mill models the _build graph_ using the functional call graph of your methods,
while Mill models the _module hierarchy_ using the object graph of your modules. And
this is not just a superficial resemblance, but the semantics deeply match what you would
expect in a hybrid functional/object-oriented program: Mill supports instantiating modules,
subclasses, inheritance via `extends`, `override`, `super`,
and so on.

While these are non-trivial semantics, they are semantics that should be immediately
familiar to anyone who has ever passed programming 101 in college. You already _know_
how `override` works or how `super` works in Mill, even if nobody told you! This approach
of "making your build code feel just like your application code" is the key to Mill's
approachability to people from varying backgrounds, and to allow the "perpetual non-experts"
typically modifying a build system to do so in a familiar and intuitive manner even if
they know nothing about the Scala language.


== Why the JVM Runtime?

=== Dynamic Classloading

One often-under-appreciated facet of the Java Virtual Machine is its ability to do dynamic
classloading. This functionality is largely irrelevant in the backend-service space that Java
is often used in (where the entire codebase is present during deployment), and has largely
failed as a mechanism for running un-trusted potentially-malicious code in a safe sandbox
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet[Applets]).

However, in the case of a build system, the need is different: you need to dynamically build,
load, and run a wide variety of mostly-trusted code. Most build systems do not provide any
hard security boundaries, and assume the code you get from your source control system is
not malicious. But build systems need to be pluggable, with the same build system
potentially being used to manage a wide variety of different tools and frameworks.

It is in this context that the JVM's dynamic classloading shines, and Mill goes all in
dynamic classloading. Features like xref:extending/import-ivy-plugins.adoc[import $ivy],
xref:extending/running-jvm-code.adoc[Running Dynamic JVM Code], or the
xref:extending/meta-build.adoc[Mill Meta-Build] would be difficult-to-impossible in
less-dynamic platforms like Go, Swift, Rust, or C++. Mill simultaneously takes advantage of
the Scala language's xref:#_static_typing[Static Typing], while also leaning heavily on the
JVM's dynamic nature: it uses classloader hierarchies, dynamic class loading and unloading,
isolated and partially-isolated classloaders, bytecode instrumentation, the whole works.
It wouldn't be a stretch to say that a build tool like Mill could not be written on top of
any other platform than the JVM it runs on today.

=== Huge JVM Tooling Ecosystem

The JVM ecosystem is huge, not just for the Java language but also things like Kotlin, Scala,
Android, and so on. IDEs, debuggers, profilers, heap analyzers, if a software tool exists
you can bet there is an equivalent or integration with the JVM ecosystem.

From the perspective of IDE support, Mill is able to get (almost) full support for understanding
and navigating its `build.mill` files, basically for free: IntelliJ already has deep support
for understanding JVM code, classfiles, classpaths, the Scala language itself, and so on.
VSCode also works pretty well out-of-the-box with minimal modifications.

Apart from the IDE, the Java ecosystem has perhaps some of the best tooling available of
any programming ecosystem, both free and proprietary, and Mill makes heavy use of it. If
a build is stuck, you can use `jstack` to see what it is doing. If a build is slow or running
out of memory, you can hook it up to https://www.ej-technologies.com/jprofiler[JProfiler]
or https://www.yourkit.com/[Yourkit] to see what is taking up space.

Lastly there is the wealth of libraries: if something has a programming language integration,
there probably is one for Java, and Mill can make use of any Java libraries seamlessly
as part of the build using xref:extending/import-ivy-plugins.adoc[import $ivy] or
xref:extending/running-jvm-code.adoc[dynamic classloading]. With Mill, the ability to
directly import _any JVM artifact on the planet_ without needing a purpose-built plugin
open ups an enormous about of possibilities: anything that can be done in the Java ecosystem
can be done as part of your Mill build with a
single xref:extending/import-ivy-plugins.adoc[import $ivy].

=== Built-in Publishing Infrastructure

The last major benefit Mill gets from running on the JVM is the publishing infrastructure:
primarily Sonatype's https://central.sonatype.com/[Maven Central]. Mill has a rich and
constantly growing set of xref:extending/thirdparty-plugins.adoc[Third-Party Plugins] that
are published on Maven Central for people to use, and anyone can easily
xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc[write and publish their own]. While Maven Central isn't
perfect, it does a solid job as a package repository: hosting an enormous catalog of
artifacts for the Java community to build upon, with nice properties such as
https://central.sonatype.org/register/namespace/[namespacing],
https://search.maven.org/[discoverability],
https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/immutability/[immutability],
and https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/#sign-files-with-gpgpgp[code signing].
Apart from Maven Central itself, there is a wealth of other hosted or self-hosted JVM
package repositories available for you to choose.

Mill makes heavy use of Maven Central and the rest of the Java publishing infrastructure:
Mill's own artifacts are all published on Maven Central, Mill builds can resolve any
artifact from Maven Central to use in your build, and anyone can publish their own plugins
to Maven Central for free. it is easy to
xref:javalib/dependencies.adoc#_repository_config[configure alternate repositories],
and Mill provides a wealth of xref:fundamentals/library-deps.adoc[tools and techniques for
working with JVM dependencies].

Most build tools end up with some half-baked plugin distribution model: downloading source
code off of Github, ad-hoc package formats or zip files, published artifacts that can be
sneakily changed or even deleted after the fact, and so on. Mill instead relies on
the widely-used publishing and distribution system that every JVM project already uses,
providing a predictable and well-designed publishing and artifact distribution experience
far beyond what can be provided by most other build tools.
