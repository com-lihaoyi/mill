= Mill: A Fast JVM Build Tool

```graphviz
digraph G {

  newrank=true;
  subgraph cluster_0 {
    style=dashed
    node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]

    "foo.sources" -> "foo.compile" -> "foo.classPath" -> "foo.assembly"
    "foo.resources" -> "foo.assembly"
    "foo.classPath"
  }
  subgraph cluster_1 {
    style=dashed
    node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
    label = "bar";

    "foo.classPath" -> "bar.compile" [constraint=false]
    "foo.classPath" -> "bar.classPath"

Mill is a fast, scalable, multi-language build tool that supports Java, Scala,
and Kotlin:

* Mill can build the same Java codebase xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[5-10x faster than Maven],
or xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc[2-4x faster than Gradle]

* Mill's typed config language and immutable xref:depth/design-principles.adoc[task graph]
helps keep builds clean and understandable

* Mill scales well from small single-module projects
to xref:depth/large-builds.adoc[large monorepos] with hundreds of modules

Although the Java compiler is very fast and the Java language is easy to learn,
JVM build tools have a reputation for being sluggish and confusing. Mill tries to
offer a better alternative, letting your build system take full advantage of the
Java platform's performance and usability:

* *Performance*: Mill's xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc[build graph] automatically
xref:depth/evaluation-model.adoc#_caching_at_each_layer_of_the_evaluation_model[caches]
and xref:cli/flags.adoc#_jobs_j[parallelizes] build
tasks, keeping your workflows fast and responsive. Mill adds minimal overhead over
the logic necessary to build your project, while providing tools to let you identify
and resolve bottlenecks in your build

* *Maintainability*: Mill goes beyond YAML and Bash, with config and custom logic written in
xref:javalib/intro.adoc#_custom_build_logic[concise type-checked code],
and an immutable xref:depth/design-principles.adoc[module tree and task graph]. This
catches config issues early, and helps IDEs
(xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_intellij[IntelliJ] or
xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_vscode[VSCode])
understand your Mill build better than any other build system

* *Flexibility*: Mill's tasks and modules allow anything from adding
xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc#primitive-tasks[simple build steps], up to
entire xref:extending/new-language.adoc[language toolchains].
You can xref:extending/import-ivy-plugins.adoc[import any JVM library] in your build,
use Mill's rich ecosystem of xref:extending/thirdparty-plugins.adoc[Third-Party Mill Plugins],
or xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc[write plugins] yourself and
xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc#_publishing[publish them] to Maven Central for others to use.

Mill is used to build many real-world projects, such as the
https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0[C3P0 JDBC Connection Pool],
https://github.com/coursier/coursier[Coursier JVM dependency resolver],
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/Ammonite[Ammonite REPL], and the
https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL[SpinalHDL] and
https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel[Chisel] hardware design frameworks.
Mill can be used for applications built on top of common JVM frameworks like
xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_spring_boot_todomvc_app[Spring Boot] or
xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_micronaut_todomvc_app[Micronaut].

Mill borrows ideas from other tools like https://maven.apache.org/[Maven],
https://gradle.org/[Gradle], https://bazel.build/[Bazel], but tries to learn from the
strengths of each tool and improve on their weaknesses. For comparisons with existing
build tools, check out these pages:

* xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[Mill vs Maven]
* xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc[Mill vs Gradle]
* xref:comparisons/sbt.adoc[Mill vs SBT]

benefits discussed above, check out the page on xref:depth/design-principles.adoc[Mill Design Principles].
