= Mill: A Fast JVM Build Tool

include::partial$gtag-config.adoc[]


Mill is a fast, scalable, multi-language build tool that supports Java, Scala,
and Kotlin:

* Mill can build the same Java codebase xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[4-10x faster than Maven],
or xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc[2-4x faster than Gradle]

* Mill's typed config language and immutable xref:depth/design-principles.adoc[task graph]
helps keep builds clean and understandable

* Mill is an easier alternative to https://bazel.build/[Bazel]
for xref:large/large.adoc[large multi-language monorepos] with hundreds of modules

To get started using Mill, see:

* xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc[]

Or see the language-specific introductory documentation linked below:

=== Why Mill?

Although the Java compiler is very fast and the Java language is easy to learn,
JVM build tools have a reputation for being sluggish and confusing. Mill tries to
offer a better alternative, letting your build system take full advantage of the
Java platform's performance and usability:

* *Performance*: Mill automatically
xref:depth/execution-model.adoc#_caching_in_mill[caches]
and xref:cli/flags.adoc#_jobs_j[parallelizes] build tasks to keep local development fast,
and avoids the long configuration times seen in other tools like Gradle or SBT.
xref:large/selective-execution.adoc[Selective execution] keeps
CI validation times short by only running the tests necessary to validate a code change.

* *Maintainability*: Mill's config and xref:javalib/intro.adoc#_custom_build_logic[custom logic]
is written in xref:depth/why-scala.adoc[concise type-checked Scala code],
with an immutable xref:depth/design-principles.adoc[module tree and task graph]. This
catches config issues early, and helps both humans and IDEs
(xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_intellij[IntelliJ] or
xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc#_vscode[VSCode])
understand your Mill build better than any other build system

* *Flexibility*: Mill's tasks and modules allow anything from adding
xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc#primitive-tasks[simple build steps], up to
entire xref:extending/example-python-support.adoc[language toolchains].
You can xref:extending/import-ivy-plugins.adoc[import any JVM library] in your build,
use Mill's rich ecosystem of xref:extending/thirdparty-plugins.adoc[Third-Party Mill Plugins],
or xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc[write plugins yourself] and
publish them to Maven Central for others to use.

Mill is used to build many real-world projects, such as the
https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0[C3P0 JDBC Connection Pool],
https://github.com/coursier/coursier[Coursier dependency resolver],
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/Ammonite[Ammonite REPL], and the
https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL[SpinalHDL] and
https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel[Chisel] hardware design frameworks.
Mill can be used for applications built on top of common JVM frameworks like
Spring Boot (both xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_spring_boot_todomvc_app[in Java]
and xref:kotlinlib/web-examples.adoc#_spring_boot_todomvc_app[in Kotlin]),
xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_micronaut_todomvc_app[Micronaut],
or xref:kotlinlib/web-examples.adoc#_ktor_todomvc_app[Ktor].

Mill borrows ideas from other tools like https://maven.apache.org/[Maven],
https://gradle.org/[Gradle], https://bazel.build/[Bazel], but tries to learn from the
strengths of each tool and improve on their weaknesses. For comparisons with existing
