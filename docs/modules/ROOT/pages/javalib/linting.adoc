This page will discuss common topics around enforcing the code quality of Java
codebases using the Mill build tool


== Linting with ErrorProne

include::partial$example/javalib/linting/1-error-prone.adoc[]

== Linting with Checkstyle

include::partial$example/javalib/linting/2-checkstyle.adoc[]

== AutoFormatting with Palantir Java Format

include::partial$example/javalib/linting/3-palantirformat.adoc[]

== Code Coverage with Jacoco

Mill supports Java code coverage analysis via the mill-jacoco plugin. See the
plugin repository documentation for more details:

* https://github.com/lefou/mill-jacoco

== Binary Compatibility Enforcement

If you want to lint against binary compatibility breakages, e.g. when developing
an upstream library that downstream libraries may compile against, you can use
the Lightbend Migration Manager (MiMa) tool via the mill-mima plugin. See
the mill-mima documentation for more details:
