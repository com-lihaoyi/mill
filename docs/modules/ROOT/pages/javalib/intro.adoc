// Author Notes:
//
// This is the first page a user is expected to land on when learning about
// Mill. It is designed to be a quick, broad overview to get someone started:
// what is Mill, why should they care, and what some simple Mill builds look
// like and how to use them. We intentionally touch shallowly on a lot of
// topics without giving them a proper discussion, since the other pages have
// plenty of space to go in-depth.
//
// By the end of this page, a prospective Mill user should be familiar with
// what Mill is, hopefully have downloaded an example to try out, and be
// interested in learning more about the Mill build tool

Mill is used to build some real-world Java projects, such as the
https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0[C3P0 JDBC Connection Pool], and
can be used for applications built on top of common Java frameworks like
xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_spring_boot_todomvc_app[Spring Boot] or
xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_micronaut_todomvc_app[Micronaut].
