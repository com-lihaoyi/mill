// Author Notes:
//
// This is the first page a user is expected to land on when learning about
// Mill. It is designed to be a quick, broad overview to get someone started:
// what is Mill, why should they care, and what some simple Mill builds look
// like and how to use them. We intentionally touch shallowly on a lot of
// topics without giving them a proper discussion, since the other pages have
// plenty of space to go in-depth.
//
// By the end of this page, a prospective Mill user should be familiar with
// what Mill is, hopefully have downloaded an example to try out, and be
// interested in learning more about the Mill build tool
