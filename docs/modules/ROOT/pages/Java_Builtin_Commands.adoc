= Built-in Commands

Mill comes with a number of useful commands out of the box. These are listed
in the Scaladoc:

* {mill-doc-url}/api/latest/mill/main/MainModule.html[mill.main.MainModule]

Mill's built-in commands are typically not directly related to building your
application code, but instead are utilities that help you understand and work
with your Mill build.
