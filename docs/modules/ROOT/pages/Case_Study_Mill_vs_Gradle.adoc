This page compares using Mill to Gradle, using the https://github.com/mockito/mockito[Mockito Testing Library]
codebase as the example. Mockito is a medium sized codebase, 100,000 lines of Java split over 22
subprojects. By porting it to Mill, this case study should give you
an idea of how Mill compares to Gradle in more realistic, real-world projects.

To do this, we have written a Mill `build.sc` file for the Mockito project. This can be used
with Mill to build and test the various submodules of the Mockito project without needing to
change any other files in the repository:

- https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/blob/main/example/thirdparty/mockity/build.sc[Mockito build.sc file]

== Completeness

The Mill build for Mockito is not 100% complete, but it covers most of the major parts of Mockito:
compiling Java, running JUnit tests. For now, the Android, Kotlin, and OSGI tests are skipped.

The goal of this exercise is not to be 100% feature complete enough to replace the Gradle build
today. It is instead meant to provide a realistic comparison of how using Mill in a realistic,
real-world project compares to using Gradle.

== Performance

The Mill build for Mockito is generally snappier than the Gradle build. This applies to
most workflows, but the difference matters most for workflows which are short-lived,
where the difference in the fixed overhead of the build tool is most noticeable.

For comparison purposes, I disabled the Gradle subprojects that we did not fully implement in Mill
(`groovyTest`, `groovyInlineTest`, `kotlinTest`, `kotlinReleaseCoroutinesTest`, `android`,
`osgi-test`, `java21-test`).

For the benchmarks below, each provided number is the median wall time of three consecutive runs
on my M1 Macbook Pro. While ad-hoc, these benchmarks are enough to give you a flavor of how
Mill's performance compares to Maven:

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
| Benchmark | Gradle | Mill | Speedup

| <<Sequential Clean Compile All>> | 17.6s | 5.40s | 3.3x
| <<Parallel Clean Compile All>> | 12.3s | 3.57s | 3.4x
| <<Clean Compile Single-Module>> | 4.41s | 1.20s | 3.7x
| <<Incremental Compile Single-Module>> | 1.37s | 0.51s | 2.7x
| <<No-Op Compile Single-Module>> | 0.94s | 0.46s | 2.0x
|===

The column on the right shows the speedups of how much faster Mill is compared to the
equivalent Maven workflow. In most cases,  Mill is 5-10x faster than Gradle. Below, we
will go into more detail of each benchmark: how they were run, what they mean, and how
we can explain the difference in performing the same task with the two different build tools.

=== Sequential Clean Compile All

```bash
$ ./gradlew clean; time ./gradlew classes testClasses --no-build-cache
17.6s
18.2s
17.4s

$ ./mill clean; time ./mill -j 1 __.compile
5.60s
5.40s
6.13s
```

This benchmark measures the time taken to sequentially compiled all the Java code in
the Mockito code base. The goal of this benchmark is to try and measure the "clean compile
everything" step, without the effects of parallelism that can be nondeterministic and vary
wildly from machine to machine depending on the number of cores available.

To limit our comparison to compiling Java code only, we avoid
using `build` in favor of `classes` and `testClasses`: this skips running tests,
lint, jar/docjar generation, and other steps that `build` performs to make it an apples-to-apples
comparison. Furthermore, Gradle parallelizes the build by default and caches things globally
under `~/.gradle/caches`, while Mill parallelizes by default but does not cache things globally.
Again to make it a fair comparison, we use `--no-build-cache` in Gradle and set
`org.gradle.parallel=false` in `gradle.properties`, and pass `-j 1` to limit Mill to a
single thread.

Here we see Mill being about ~3.3x faster than Gradle, to do the equivalent amount of work.

=== Parallel Clean Compile All

```bash
$ ./gradlew clean; time ./gradlew classes testClasses --no-build-cache
13.8s
12.3s
11.4s

$ ./mill clean; time ./mill -j 10  __.compile
3.59s
3.57s
3.45s
```

This benchmark is identical to the <<Sequential Clean Compile All>> benchmark above, but enables
parallelism: Gradle by default, Mill via `-j 10` to run on 10 cores (the number on my Macbook Pro).

Neither Gradle nor Mill benefit hugely from parallelism: both show a moderate ~50% speedup,
despite receiving 900% more CPUs. This likely indicates that the module dependency graph
of the Mockito codebase is laid out in a way that does not allow huge amounts of compile-time
parallelism.

Again, we see Mill being about ~3.4x faster than Gradle, to do the equivalent amount of work.
This indicates the the speedup Mill provides over Gradle is unrelated to the parallelism of
each tool.

=== Clean Compile Single-Module

```bash
$ ./gradlew clean; time ./gradlew :classes --no-build-cache
4.14s
4.41s
4.41s

$ ./mill clean; time ./mill compile
1.20s
1.12s
1.30s
```

This benchmark indicates the use case of clean-compiling a single module. In this case,
the root module in `src/main/java/` containing the bulk of the Mockito library code,
_exluding_ the test code in `src/test/java/` and all the downstream subprojects in 
`subprojects/`.

This benchmark gives us Mill being about ~3.7x faster than Gradle. This is in line with
the results above.

=== Incremental Compile Single-Module

```bash
$ echo "" >> src/main/java/org/mockito/BDDMockito.java; time ./gradlew :classes
1.37s
1.39s
1.28s

$ echo "" >> src/main/java/org/mockito/BDDMockito.java; time ./mill compile
compiling 1 Java source to /Users/lihaoyi/Github/netty/out/common/compile.dest/classes ...
0.52s
0.51s
0.52s
```

This benchmark measures the common case of making a tiny change to a single file and
re-compiling just that module. This is the common workflow that most software developers
do over and over day-in and day-out. We simulate this by appending a new line to the
file `src/main/java/org/mockito/BDDMockito.java`.

Both Mill and Gradle are able to take advantage of the small code change and re-compile
only the single files needing re-compilation, demonstrating substantial speedups over
the <<Clean Compile Single-Module>> benchmark above. Mill remains faster than Gradle,
showing a ~2.7x speedup for this task

=== No-Op Compile Single-Module

```bash
$ time ./gradlew :classes
0.95s
0.93s
0.94s

$ time ./mill common.compile
0.46s
0.50s
0.45s
```

This benchmark is meant to measure the pure overhead of running the build tool: given a single
module that did _not_ change, the build tool should need to do _nothing_ in response, and so
any time taken is pure overhead.

For both Mill and Gradle, we see small speedups relative to the <<Incremental Compile Single-Module>>
benchmark above, which likely comes from not having to compile any Java source files at all. Mill
remains faster than Gradle by about 2.0x.


== Conclusion


Both the Mill and Gradle builds we discussed in this case study do the same thing: they
compile Java code and run tests. Sometimes they perform additional configuration, tweaking
JVM arguments or doing ad-hoc classpath mangling.

Mill doesn't try to do _more_ than Gradle does, but it
tries to do it _better_: faster compiles, shorter and easier to read configs, easier
extensibility via libraries.

Again, the Mill build used in this comparison is for demonstration purposes, and more
work would be necessary to make the Mill build production ready: publishing configuration,
code coverage integration, and so on. However, hopefully it demonstrates the potential value:
significantly improved performance, so that you spend less time waiting for your code to
compile and more time doing the work that actually matters.
