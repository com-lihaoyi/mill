== Reproducibility and Determinism

Selective execution relies on the inputs to your project being deterministic
and reproducible, except for the code changes between the two versions, so that
Mill can compare the state of the build inputs before and after and only run
tasks downstream of those that changed. This is usually the case, but there are
some subtleties to be aware of:

- *Dynamic `Task.Input` to capture Git metadata must be disabled*, e.g. using
  https://github.com/lefou/mill-vcs-version[mill-vcs-version]. The easiest way to do
  this is to guard such dynamic inputs on an environment variable, such that
  in most scenarios it returns a constant `"SNAPSHOT"` string, and only when
  necessary do you pass in the environment variable to compute a real version (e.g.
  during publishing)

```scala
def myProjectVersion: T[String] = Task.Input {
  if (Task.env.contains("MY_PROJECT_STABLE_VERSION")) VcsVersion.calcVcsState(Task.log).format()
  else "SNAPSHOT"
}
```

- *The filesystem layout and position of the before/after codebases must be exactly
  the same*. This is not an issue when running `selective.prepare`/`selective.run` on
  the same folder on one machine, but if the two calls are run on separate machines
  you need to make sure the directory path is the same.

- *You must use the same Operating System amd Filesystem*, as differences there will
  cause the filesystem signatures to change and thus spuriously trigger downstream tasks.
  e.g. you cannot run `selective.prepare` on a Windows machine and `selective.run` on Linux

- *Filesystem permissions must be preserved before/after*. e.g. running `selective,run}`
  on different Github Actions machines sharing artifacts can cause issues as
  `upload-artifact`/`download-artifact` https://github.com/actions/download-artifact#permission-loss[does not preserve filesystem permissions].
  If this is an issue, you can run `chmod -R . 777` before each of `selective.{prepare,run}`
  to ensure they have the exact same filesystem permissions.


== Debugging Selective Execution

* Use `selective.resolve` before `selective.run`: this will print out what it was going to run,
  and can give you a chance to eyeball if the list of targets to run makes sense or not

* Look at xref:fundamentals/out-dir.adoc#_mill_invalidation_tree_json[out/mill-invalidation-tree.json],
  whether on disk locally or printing it out (e.g via `cat`) on your CI machines to diagnose issues
  there. This would give you a richer view of what source tasks or inputs are the ones actually
  triggered the invalidation, and what tasks were just invalidated due to being downstream of them.


== Limitations

* *Selective execution can only work at the Mill Task granularity*. e.g. When working with
  Java/Scala/Kotlin modules and test modules, the granularity of selection is at entire modules.
  That means that if your modules are individually large, selective execution may not be able
  to significantly narrow down the set of tests that need to run

* *Selective execution usually cannot narrow down the set of integration tests to run*. Integration
  tests by their nature depend on the entire application or system, and run test cases that
  exercise different parts of it. But selective execution works at the task level and can only
  see that every integration test depends on the entire codebase, and so any change in the
  entire codebase could potentially affect any integration test, so selective execution will
  select all of them.

* *Selective execution is coarser-grained than runtime task caching*. e.g. If you add a newline
  to a `foo/src/Foo.java` file and run `foo.testCached`, selective testing only knows that
  `foo.sources` changed and `foo.testCached` is downstream of it, but it cannot know that
  when you run `foo.compile` on the changed sources, the compilation output is unchanged, and
  so `.testCached` can be skipped. This is inherent in the nature of selective execution, which
  does its analysis without evaluation-time information and thus will always be more conservative
  than the task skipping and cache-reuse that is done during evaluation.
