// Author Notes:
//
// This is the first page a user is expected to land on when learning about
// Mill. It is designed to be a quick, broad overview to get someone started:
// what is Mill, why should they care, and what some simple Mill builds look
// like and how to use them. We intentionally touch shallowly on a lot of
// topics without giving them a proper discussion, since the other pages have
// plenty of space to go in-depth.
//
// By the end of this page, a prospective Mill user should be familiar with
// what Mill is, hopefully have downloaded an example to try out, and be
// interested in learning more about the Mill build tool

Mill is far easier to understand, maintain, and extend than other Scala build tools
like SBT. Mill leverages concepts you already know: objects, methods, inheritance and
overrides, meaning that any Scala programmer can start using Mill and immediately know
how things work.

If you are coming from a SBT background, the following blog posts discuss some of the
fundamental design issues with SBT, and how Mill attempts to do better:
