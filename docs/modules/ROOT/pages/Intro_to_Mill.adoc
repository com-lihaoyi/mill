// Author Notes:
//
// This is the first page a user is expected to land on when learning about
// Mill. It is designed to be a quick, broad overview to get someone started:
// what is Mill, why should they care, and what some simple Mill builds look
// like and how to use them. We intentionally touch shallowly on a lot of
// topics without giving them a proper discussion, since the other pages have
// plenty of space to go in-depth.
//
// By the end of this page, a prospective Mill user should be familiar with
// what Mill is, hopefully have downloaded an example to try out, and be
// interested in learning more about the Mill build tool

:page-aliases: index.adoc

{mill-github-url}[Mill] is your shiny new Scala/Java build tool! Mill aims for
simplicity by reusing concepts you are already familiar with, borrowing ideas
from modern tools like https://bazel.build/[Bazel] and
https://www.scala-sbt.org/[SBT]. It lets you build your projects in a way
that's simple, fast, and predictable.

Mill automates dealing with a lot of common build-tool concerns: Caching,
incremental re-computation, parallelism, discoverability, etc. This allows you
to focus your effort on the business logic unique to your build, while letting
Mill take care of all the rest.

Mill has built-in support for the https://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala]
programming language, and can serve as a replacement for
http://www.scala-sbt.org/[SBT]. It can be xref:Extending_Mill.adoc[extended]
to support any other language or platform via modules (written in Java
or Scala) or through external subprocesses. Mill supports a rich ecosystem of
xref:Contrib_Plugins.adoc[] and xref:Thirdparty_Plugins.adoc[].

If you are using Mill, you will find the following book by the Author useful in
using Mill and its supporting libraries to the fullest:

The rest of this page contains a quick introduction to getting start with using
Mill to build a simple Scala program. The other pages of this doc-site go into
more depth, with more examples of how to use Mill and more details of how the
Mill build tool works.

== Custom Build Logic

== Multi-Module Project

== Watch and Re-evaluate

You can use the `--watch` flag to make Mill watch a task's inputs,
re-evaluating the task as necessary when the inputs
change:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill --watch foo.compile
$ mill --watch foo.run
$ mill -w foo.compile
$ mill -w foo.run
----

Mill's `--watch` flag watches both the files you are building using Mill, as
well as Mill's own `build.sc` file and anything it imports, so any changes to
your `build.sc` will automatically get picked up.

For long-running processes like web servers, you can use `runBackground` to make sure they recompile and restart when code changes,
forcefully terminating the previous process even though it may be still alive:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill -w foo.compile
$ mill -w foo.runBackground
----


== Parallel Task Execution

By default, mill will evaluate all tasks in sequence.
But mill also supports processing tasks in parallel.
This feature is currently experimental and we encourage you to report any issues
you find on our bug tracker.

To enable parallel task execution, use the `--jobs` (`-j`) option followed by a
number of maximal parallel threads.

Example: Use up to 4 parallel threads to compile all modules:

[source,bash]
----
mill -j 4 __.compile
----

To use as many threads as your machine has (logical) processor cores use `--jobs 0`.
To disable parallel execution use `--jobs 1`. This is currently the default.

`mill -j` generates an output file in `out/mill-chrome-profile.json` that can be
loaded into the Chrome browser's `chrome://tracing` page for visualization.
This can make it much easier to analyze your parallel runs to find out what's
taking the most time:

Please note that the maximal possible parallelism depends on your project.
Tasks that depend on each other can't be processed in parallel.

== Command-line usage

Mill is a command-line tool and supports various options.

Run `mill --help` for a complete list of options

.Output of `mill --help`
----
Mill Build Tool, version {mill-version}
usage: mill [options] [[target [target-options]] [+ [target ...]]]
  -D --define <k=v>    Define (or overwrite) a system property.
  -b --bell            Ring the bell once if the run completes successfully, twice if it fails.
  --bsp                Enable BSP server mode.
  --color <bool>       Enable or disable colored output; by default colors are enabled in both REPL
                       and scripts mode if the console is interactive, and disabled otherwise.
  -d --debug           Show debug output on STDOUT
  --disable-ticker     Disable ticker log (e.g. short-lived prints of stages and progress bars).
  -h --home <path>     (internal) The home directory of internally used Ammonite script engine;
                       where it looks for config and caches.
  --help               Print this help message and exit.
  -i --interactive     Run Mill in interactive mode, suitable for opening REPLs and taking user
                       input. This implies --no-server and no mill server will be used. Must be the
                       first argument.
  --import <str>       Additional ivy dependencies to load into mill, e.g. plugins.
  -j --jobs <int>      Allow processing N targets in parallel. Use 1 to disable parallel and 0 to
                       use as much threads as available processors.
  -k --keep-going      Continue build, even after build failures.
  --no-default-predef  Disable the default predef and run Mill with the minimal predef possible.
  --no-server          Run Mill in single-process mode. In this mode, no mill server will be started
                       or used. Must be the first argument.
  -p --predef <path>   Lets you load your predef from a custom location, rather than the "default
                       location in your Ammonite home
  -s --silent          Make ivy logs during script import resolution go silent instead of printing;
                       though failures will still throw exception.
  -v --version         Show mill version information and exit.
  -w --watch           Watch and re-run your scripts when they change.
  target <str>...      The name or a pattern of the target(s) you want to build, followed by any
                       parameters you wish to pass to those targets. To specify multiple target
                       names or patterns, use the `+` separator.
----

All _options_ must be given before the first target.
