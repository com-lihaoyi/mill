// Author Notes:
//
// This is the first page a user is expected to land on when learning about
// Mill. It is designed to be a quick, broad overview to get someone started:
// what is Mill, why should they care, and what some simple Mill builds look
// like and how to use them. We intentionally touch shallowly on a lot of
// topics without giving them a proper discussion, since the other pages have
// plenty of space to go in-depth.
//
// By the end of this page, a prospective Mill user should be familiar with
// what Mill is, hopefully have downloaded an example to try out, and be
// interested in learning more about the Mill build tool

{mill-github-url}[Mill] is your shiny new Scala/Java build tool! Mill aims for
simplicity by reusing concepts you are already familiar with, borrowing ideas
from modern tools like https://bazel.build/[Bazel] and
https://www.scala-sbt.org/[SBT]. It lets you build your projects in a way
that's simple, fast, and predictable.

Mill automates dealing with a lot of common build-tool concerns: Caching,
incremental re-computation, parallelism, discoverability, etc. This allows you
to focus your effort on the business logic unique to your build, while letting
Mill take care of all the rest.

Mill has built-in support for the https://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala]
programming language, and can serve as a replacement for
http://www.scala-sbt.org/[SBT]. It can be xref:Extending_Mill.adoc[extended]
to support any other language or platform via modules (written in Java
or Scala) or through external subprocesses. Mill supports a rich ecosystem of
xref:Contrib_Plugins.adoc[] and xref:Thirdparty_Plugins.adoc[].

If you are using Mill, you will find the following book by the Author useful in
using Mill and its supporting libraries to the fullest:

If you prefer a video introduction rather than text, the following presentation
(and companion blog post) is a good introduction into what the Mill build tool is 
all about:

The rest of this page contains a quick introduction to getting start with using
Mill to build a simple Scala program. The other pages of this doc-site go into
more depth, with more examples of how to use Mill and more details of how the
Mill build tool works.

== Watch and Re-evaluate

You can use the `--watch` flag to make Mill watch a task's inputs,
re-evaluating the task as necessary when the inputs
change:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill --watch foo.compile
$ mill --watch foo.run
$ mill -w foo.compile
$ mill -w foo.run
----

Mill's `--watch` flag watches both the files you are building using Mill, as
well as Mill's own `build.sc` file and anything it imports, so any changes to
your `build.sc` will automatically get picked up.

For long-running processes like web servers, you can use `runBackground` to make sure they recompile and restart when code changes,
forcefully terminating the previous process even though it may be still alive:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill -w foo.compile
$ mill -w foo.runBackground
----


== Parallel Task Execution

By default, mill will evaluate all tasks in sequence.
But mill also supports processing tasks in parallel.
This feature is currently experimental and we encourage you to report any issues
you find on our bug tracker.

To enable parallel task execution, use the `--jobs` (`-j`) option followed by a
number of maximal parallel threads.

Example: Use up to 4 parallel threads to compile all modules:

[source,bash]
----
mill -j 4 __.compile
----

To use as many threads as your machine has (logical) processor cores use `--jobs 0`.
To disable parallel execution use `--jobs 1`. This is currently the default.

`mill -j` generates an output file in `out/mill-chrome-profile.json` that can be
loaded into the Chrome browser's `chrome://tracing` page for visualization.
This can make it much easier to analyze your parallel runs to find out what's
taking the most time:

Please note that the maximal possible parallelism depends on your project.
Tasks that depend on each other can't be processed in parallel.

== Command-line usage

Mill is a command-line tool and supports various options.

Run `mill --help` for a complete list of options

Mill Build Tool, version {mill-version}
usage: mill [options] [[target [target-options]] [+ [target ...]]]
  -D --define <k=v>                 Define (or overwrite) a system property.
  -b --bell                         Ring the bell once if the run completes successfully, twice if
                                    it fails.
  --bsp                             Enable BSP server mode.
  --color <bool>                    Enable or disable colored output; by default colors are enabled
                                    in both REPL and scripts mode if the console is interactive, and
                                    disabled otherwise.
  -d --debug                        Show debug output on STDOUT
  --disable-callgraph-invalidation  Disable the fine-grained callgraph-based target invalidation in
                                    response to code changes, and instead fall back to the previous
                                    coarse-grained implementation relying on the script `import
                                    $file` graph
  --disable-ticker                  Disable ticker log (e.g. short-lived prints of stages and
                                    progress bars).
  --enable-ticker <bool>            Enable ticker log (e.g. short-lived prints of stages and
                                    progress bars).
  -h --home <path>                  (internal) The home directory of internally used Ammonite script
                                    engine; where it looks for config and caches.
  --help                            Print this help message and exit.
  -i --interactive                  Run Mill in interactive mode, suitable for opening REPLs and
                                    taking user input. This implies --no-server and no mill server
                                    will be used. Must be the first argument.
  --import <str>                    Additional ivy dependencies to load into mill, e.g. plugins.
  -j --jobs <int>                   Allow processing N targets in parallel. Use 1 to disable
                                    parallel and 0 to use as much threads as available processors.
  -k --keep-going                   Continue build, even after build failures.
  --meta-level <int>                Experimental: Select a meta-build level to run the given
                                    targets. Level 0 is the normal project, level 1 the first
                                    meta-build, and so on. The last level is the built-in synthetic
                                    meta-build which Mill uses to bootstrap the project.
  --no-server                       Run Mill in single-process mode. In this mode, no Mill server
                                    will be started or used. Must be the first argument.
  -s --silent                       Make ivy logs during script import resolution go silent instead
                                    of printing; though failures will still throw exception.
  -v --version                      Show mill version information and exit.
  -w --watch                        Watch and re-run your scripts when they change.
  target <str>...                   The name or a pattern of the target(s) you want to build,
                                    followed by any parameters you wish to pass to those targets. To
                                    specify multiple target names or patterns, use the `+`
                                    separator.
----

All _options_ must be given before the first target.
