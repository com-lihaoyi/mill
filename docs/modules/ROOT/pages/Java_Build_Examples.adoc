= Java Build Examples

On this page, we will explore the Mill build tool via a series of simple Java
example projects. Each project demonstrates one particular feature of the Mill
build tool, and is also an executable codebase you can download and run. By the
end of this page, you will be familiar with how to configure Mill to work with
realistic Scala codebases: cross-building, testing, and publishing them.


Many of the APIs covered here are listed in the documentation:
