= Cross Builds

Cross-building refers to taking the same sources and configuration and building
it multiple times with minor changes. This could mean taking the same Scala
codebase and building it across multiple Scala versions, taking the same
application and building twice for dev/release, or taking the same module
config and building it across a variety of source folders.
