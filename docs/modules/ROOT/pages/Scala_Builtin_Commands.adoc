= Built-in Commands

:page-aliases: Scala_Builtin_Commands.adoc

Mill comes with a number of useful commands out of the box. These are listed
in the Scaladoc:

* {mill-doc-url}/api/latest/mill/main/MainModule.html[mill.main.MainModule]

Mill's built-in commands are typically not directly related to building your
application code, but instead are utilities that help you understand and work
with your Mill build.

The `init` command generates a project based on a Giter8 template.
It prompts you to enter project name and creates a folder with that name.
You can use it to quickly generate a starter project.
There are lots of templates out there for many frameworks and tools!
