= Migrating to Mill

include::partial$gtag-config.adoc[]

This page documents a playbook for migrating existing projects
from Maven, Gradle, or SBT to Mill. Some build tools also have additional semi-automated
tooling (e.g. see xref:migrating/maven.adoc[]), other automation is work-in-process
(e.g. migrating from https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/issues/3962[Gradle] or
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/issues/3450[SBT]) but while automation helps with
some of the scaffolding the general principles laid out on this page still apply.

== How Long Does Migration Take?

Migrating an existing project to Mill may take anywhere from an hour for small projects
to several days or more for larger projects. These steps come from experience doing proof-of-concept
migrations of a range of real-world projects to Mill, from simple single-module codebases to
complex multi-module builds with dozens of modules:

|===
| Migrated Project | Lines | Modules | Estimated Implementation Time
| https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/tree/main/example/thirdparty/jimfs/build.mill[JimFS] | ~26kLOC | 1 module | ~2 hours
| https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/tree/main/example/thirdparty/commons-io/build.mill[Apache Commons-IO] | ~100kLOC | 1 module | ~2 hours
| https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/tree/main/example/thirdparty/gatling/build.mill[Gatling] | ~70kLOC | 21 modules | ~1 day
| https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/tree/main/example/thirdparty/arrow/build.mill[Arrow] | ~60kLOC | 22 modules | ~5 days
| https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/tree/main/example/thirdparty/mockito/build.mill[Mockito] | ~100kLOC | 22 modules | ~5 days
| https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/tree/main/example/thirdparty/netty/build.mill[Netty] | ~500kLOC | 47 modules | ~5 days
|===



The numbers above are for proof-of-concept migrations, for someone with prior
build system expertise; you may need twice the implementation time for a complete
production-ready migration, with additional time for change-management work.

Build system migrations are not cheap, but the productivity benefits of a
faster and easier to use build system are significant (see xref:comparisons/why-mill.adoc[]),
especially multiplied over an entire team of engineers who may be working on
the codebase for multiple years. Generally the more actively a project is developed, and the
longer you expect development to continue, the more worthwhile it is to migrate from
Maven/Gradle/SBT
to Mill.

== How to Approach Migration

The basic approach taken for any such migration is as follows:

1. *The existing source code and build system for the project is to
   be left in-place and fully working.*

** This ensures you have the flexibility to back out of the migration at any point in time
** On completion, this allows you to
   perform head-to-head comparisons between old and new build systems

2. *A parallel Mill build is set up for the project.*

** Sub-project `pom.xml` and `build.gradle` files need to be translated into Mill ``Module``s
** Third-party dependencies need to be translated into Mill's `def ivyDeps`
** Third-party Plugins need to be replaced by their Mill equivalent, or re-implemented
** Custom build logic may need to be re-implemented in Mill

3. *Once completed, the Mill build can be used as the default for some period of time*

** This period gives the time to be confident in the robustness of the new Mill build system,
   during which both old and new build systems should be maintained and kept up top date.

4. *After you are comfortable with the new Mill build, the old build
   system can be removed.*

Of the four steps above, most of the work goes into (2) setting up the parallel Mill
build for your project. We will walk through each of the sub-bullets in that step
below

== Translating Subprojects to Modules

* Download a `mill` bootstrap file as discussed in xref:cli/installation-ide.adoc[] and
  create a `build.mill` file as described in xref:javalib/intro.adoc[]

* Define a Mill `Module` for each subproject in the existing build,
   and a `test` module for each.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Build Tool | Dependency
| Java
a|
```scala
object foo extends MavenModule{
  object test extends MavenTests{
  }
}
```

| Kotlin
a|
```scala
object foo extends KotlinMavenModule{
  object test extends KotlinMavenTests{
  }
}
```

| Scala
a|
```scala
object foo extends SbtModule{
  object test extends SbtTests{
  }
}
```
|===


* These modules should have names corresponding to the existing subprojects
path on disk, e.g. a subproject inside `foo/` should be `object foo extends MavenModule`,
or a subproject `bar/qux/` should be a nested:

```scala
object bar extends MavenModule {
  object qux extends MavenModule
}
```

* Wire up the existing inter-subproject dependencies using `def moduleDeps = Seq(...)` inside `object foo`.

** Test dependencies can also be specified, using `def moduleDeps = super.moduleDeps ++ Seq(...)`
inside the `object test`. Note that test modules need to use `super.moduleDeps` to preserve
the dependency on the enclosing application module

```scala
object foo extends MavenModule{
  object test extends MavenTests{
  }
}

object bar extends MavenModule{
  def moduleDeps = Seq(foo) // application code dependency
  object test extends MavenTests{
    def moduleDeps = super.moduleDeps ++ Seq(foo) // test code dependency
  }
}
```



At this point, you have the rough skeleton of the project laid out. You can run
`./mill visualize __.compile` to show an SVG graph of how the project is laid out, and
`./mill show __.sources` to show where the source folders for each module are to eyeball
them and verify they are pointing at the right place. For a fully-self-contained project
with no external dependencies you could even compile it at this point, but most projects
will require some degree of third party dependencies that will need to be configured:


== Translating Third-Party Dependencies

* Define the third-party dependencies for each module with `def ivyDeps`.

These are a relatively straightforward translation:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Build Tool | Dependency
| Maven
a|
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
  <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
  <version>3.3.1-jre</version>
</dependency>
```

| Gradle
a|
```scala
implementation "com.google.guava:guava:3.3.1-jre"
```

| SBT
a|
```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.google.guava" % "guava" % "3.3.1-jre"
```

| Mill
a|
```scala
def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy"com.google.guava:guava:3.3.1-jre")
```
|===

If you are building a Scala project using SBT:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Build Tool | Dependency
| SBT
a|
```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.lihaoyi" %% "scalatags" % "0.12.0"
```

| Mill
a|
```scala
def ivyDeps = Agg(ivy"com.lihaoyi::scalatags:0.12.0")
```
|===

* Again, test-only third-party dependencies are defined inside the `object test` submodule.

* Compile-only dependencies can be defined with `def compileIvyDeps`, and runtime-only/provided
  dependencies defined with `def runIvyDeps`

The documentation for xref:javalib/dependencies.adoc[] and xref:fundamentals/library-deps.adoc[]
has more details: how to configure unmanaged jars, repositories, pinning versions, etc.


== Translating Third-Party Plugins

At a high level, you want to take plugins that you use in Maven/Gradle/SBT and replace
them either with builtin Mill functionality:

* xref:javalib/linting.adoc[]
* xref:javalib/testing.adoc[]
* xref:javalib/publishing.adoc[]
* Mill xref:extending/contrib-plugins.adoc[] or Mill xref:extending/thirdparty-plugins.adoc[]

Third-party plugins differ between build systems, so the configuration and behavior may
differ in minor ways, but the high-level functionality should mostly be there.

== Translating Custom Build Logic

Generally, custom build logic from your own custom plugins or extensions will need to
be re-implemented. This is usually not terribly difficult, as either the logic is simple
(just moving some files around and zipping/unzipping them), or the logic is complex but
comes from an external tool (e.g. third-party compilers, code-generators, linters, etc.)

1. For the simple cases, you can usually accomplish what you want using Mill's
   xref:javalib/intro.adoc#_custom_build_logic[custom build logic]. Mill provides bundled
   libraries for working with filesystem/subprocesses (xref:fundamentals/bundled-libraries.adoc#_os_lib[OS-Lib]),
   JSON/binary serialization (xref:fundamentals/bundled-libraries.adoc#_upickle[uPickle]),
   HTTP requests (xref:fundamentals/bundled-libraries.adoc#_requests_scala[Requests-Scala]).

2. For using third-party libraries in your build, these are usually published
   to Maven Central or some other package repository, in which case they are
   easy to directly import and use in your custom tasks (see xref:extending/import-ivy-plugins.adoc[])

3. For more sophisticated integrations, e.g. if you need to dynamically compile
   and run JVM programs or build plugins as part of your build, you can do so via
   (see xref:extending/running-jvm-code.adoc[])

== Long Tail Issues

Typically, after you are done with the rough skeleton of your new Mill build with
most things compiling, you will find that some code does not yet compile and other
code compiles but does not pass tests. There will always be a long tail of small
configuration tweaks that need to be ported from your existing build system to your
new Mill build:

* You may need to update code to use the `MILL_TEST_RESOURCE_DIR` environment variable
  rather than the `"resources/"` folder directly in code, since Mill runs tests in
  xref:depth/sandboxing.adoc[Sandboxes] that guard against unwanted filesystem access.
* Similarly, you may need to us `Task.workspace` or `mill.api.WorkspaceRoot.workspaceRoot`
  to access the project root folder in custom build tasks, since the Mill build process
  also runs in a sandbox by default
* Some tests may require xref:fundamentals/configuring-jvm-versions.adoc[] to run
* Some modules may require specific xref:javalib/module-config.adoc#_compilation_execution_flags[Compilation & Execution Flags]
* Some code may make use of xref:javalib/module-config.adoc#_annotation_processors[Annotation Processors]
* You may have xref:javalib/module-config.adoc#_native_c_code_with_jni[native code you need to compile and interop with using JNI]
* def may need to use frameworks like xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_spring_boot_hello_world_app[Spring Boot]
  or xref:javalib/web-examples.adoc#_micronaut_hello_world_app[Micronaut]

In general none of these issues are blocking, but they do require you to investigate
the various failures and figure out which part of your existing Mill build is missing.

== Cleanup

Lastly, at this point you have a Mill build that works, but you may not have a Mill build
that is easily maintainable. Mill provides a lot of tools to improve the maintainability
and understandability of your build system, and while you may not want to apply them up
front during the migration, once you have everything working you can go back and revisit
to see which ones may help:

* xref:fundamentals/modules.adoc#_trait_modules[Trait Modules] to centralize common config

* xref:large/multi-file-builds.adoc[Multi-File Builds] to let you co-locate
  build logic and the code being built

* xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc[Writing and Publishing your own Mill Plugins]
  if you want to share your build logic across multiple projects/repos in your organization

== Conclusion

As mentioned at the start of this page, migrating to a new build tool is not cheap
or easy, and can easily take a significant time commitment. Automation does help,
whether bundled in Mill or your own DIY scripts, but there will always be a long
tail of manual debugging and investigation necessary to reproduce every quirk and
idiosyncrasy of your old build system in your new Mill build.

However, while _tedious_, such migrations are usually not _difficult_. Most
build systems use a relatively small set of third-party tools with small amounts of
custom logic, and Mill has built-in integrations with many common JVM tools and
makes custom logic easy to implement. In the end the decision to migrate comes down to
the benefits of Mill (see xref:comparisons/why-mill.adoc[]) outweighing the cost of migration,
which becomes more true as the lifespan and pace of development on a project grows.
