This page compares using Mill to Gradle, using the https://github.com/mockito/mockito[Mockito Testing Library]
codebase as the example. Mockito is a medium sized codebase, 100,000 lines of Java split over 22
subprojects. By porting it to Mill, this case study should give you
an idea of how Mill compares to Gradle in more realistic, real-world projects.

To do this, we have written a Mill `build.mill` file for the Mockito project. This can be used
with Mill to build and test the various submodules of the Mockito project without needing to
change any other files in the repository:

- https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/blob/main/example/thirdparty/mockito/build.mill[Mockito build.mill file]

== Completeness

The Mill build for Mockito is not 100% complete, but it covers most of the major parts of Mockito:
compiling Java, running JUnit tests. For now, the Android, Kotlin, and OSGI tests are skipped,
as support for xref:javalib/android-examples.adoc[Building Android apps in Mill]
and xref:kotlinlib/intro.adoc[Kotlin with Mill] is still experimental.

The goal of this exercise is not to be 100% feature complete enough to replace the Gradle build
today. It is instead meant to provide a realistic comparison of how using Mill in a realistic,
real-world project compares to using Gradle.

== Performance

The Mill build for Mockito is generally snappier than the Gradle build. This applies to
most workflows, but the difference matters most for workflows which are short-lived,
where the difference in the fixed overhead of the build tool is most noticeable.

For comparison purposes, I disabled the Gradle subprojects that we did not fully implement in Mill
(`groovyTest`, `groovyInlineTest`, `kotlinTest`, `kotlinReleaseCoroutinesTest`, `android`,
`osgi-test`, `java21-test`), and added the necessary flags to ensure caching/parallelism/etc. is
configured similarly for both tools. This ensures the comparison is fair with both builds compiling the
same code and running the same tests in the same way.

For the benchmarks below, each provided number is the median wall time of three consecutive runs
on my M1 Macbook Pro. While ad-hoc, these benchmarks are enough to give you a flavor of how
Mill's performance compares to Gradle:

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
| Benchmark | Gradle | Mill | Speedup

| <<Sequential Clean Compile All>> | 17.6s | 5.40s | 3.3x
| <<Parallel Clean Compile All>> | 12.3s | 3.57s | 3.4x
| <<Clean Compile Single-Module>> | 4.41s | 1.20s | 3.7x
| <<Incremental Compile Single-Module>> | 1.37s | 0.51s | 2.7x
| <<No-Op Compile Single-Module>> | 0.94s | 0.46s | 2.0x
|===

The column on the right shows the speedups of how much faster Mill is compared to the
equivalent Gradle workflow. In most cases,  Mill is 5-10x faster than Gradle. Below, we
will go into more detail of each benchmark: how they were run, what they mean, and how
we can explain the difference in performing the same task with the two different build tools.

=== Sequential Clean Compile All

```bash
$ ./gradlew clean; time ./gradlew classes testClasses --no-build-cache
17.6s
18.2s
17.4s

$ ./mill clean; time ./mill -j 1 __.compile
5.60s
5.40s
6.13s
```

This benchmark measures the time taken to sequentially compiled all the Java code in
the Mockito code base. The goal of this benchmark is to try and measure the "clean compile
everything" step, without the effects of parallelism that can be nondeterministic and vary
wildly from machine to machine depending on the number of cores available.

To limit our comparison to compiling Java code only, we avoid
using `build` in favor of `classes` and `testClasses`: this skips running tests,
lint, jar/docjar generation, and other steps that `build` performs to make it an apples-to-apples
comparison. Furthermore, Gradle parallelizes the build by default and caches things globally
under `~/.gradle/caches`, while Mill parallelizes by default but does not cache things globally.
Again to make it a fair comparison, we use `--no-build-cache` in Gradle and set
`org.gradle.parallel=false` in `gradle.properties`, and pass `-j 1` to limit Mill to a
single thread.

Here we see Mill being about ~3.3x faster than Gradle, to do the equivalent amount of work.
As a point of reference, Java typically compiles at 10,000-50,000 lines per second on a
single thread, and the Mockito codebase is ~100,000 lines of code, so we would expect compile
to take 2-10 seconds without parallelism.
The 5-6s taken by Mill seems about what you would expect for a codebase of this size,
and the ~17s taken by Gradle is much more than what you would expect from simple Java compilation.

It's actually not clear to me where the difference in execution time is coming from. Unlike
the xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[Mill v.s. Maven comparison], Gradle's command line output
doesn't show any obvious network requests or jar packing/unpacking/comparing going on. But
Gradle's CLI output is also much less verbose than Maven's, so it's possible things are going
on under the hood that I'm not aware of.

=== Parallel Clean Compile All

```bash
$ ./gradlew clean; time ./gradlew classes testClasses --no-build-cache
13.8s
12.3s
11.4s

$ ./mill clean; time ./mill __.compile
3.59s
3.57s
3.45s
```

This benchmark is identical to the <<Sequential Clean Compile All>> benchmark above, but enables
parallelism: Gradle by default, Mill without `-j 1` to run on 10 cores (the number on my Macbook Pro).

Neither Gradle nor Mill benefit hugely from parallelism: both show a moderate ~50% speedup,
despite receiving 900% more CPUs. This likely indicates that the module dependency graph
of the Mockito codebase is laid out in a way that does not allow huge amounts of compile-time
parallelism.

Again, we see Mill being about ~3.4x faster than Gradle, to do the equivalent amount of work.
This indicates the the speedup Mill provides over Gradle is unrelated to the parallelism of
each tool.

=== Clean Compile Single-Module

```bash
$ ./gradlew clean; time ./gradlew :classes --no-build-cache
4.14s
4.41s
4.41s

$ ./mill clean; time ./mill compile
1.20s
1.12s
1.30s
```

This benchmark indicates the use case of clean-compiling a single module. In this case,
the root module in `src/main/java/` containing the bulk of the Mockito library code,
_exluding_ the test code in `src/test/java/` and all the downstream subprojects in 
`subprojects/`.

This benchmark gives us Mill being about ~3.7x faster than Gradle. This is in line with
the results above.

=== Incremental Compile Single-Module

```bash
$ echo "" >> src/main/java/org/mockito/BDDMockito.java; time ./gradlew :classes
1.37s
1.39s
1.28s

$ echo "" >> src/main/java/org/mockito/BDDMockito.java; time ./mill compile
compiling 1 Java source to /Users/lihaoyi/Github/netty/out/common/compile.dest/classes ...
0.52s
0.51s
0.52s
```

This benchmark measures the common case of making a tiny change to a single file and
re-compiling just that module. This is the common workflow that most software developers
do over and over day-in and day-out. We simulate this by appending a new line to the
file `src/main/java/org/mockito/BDDMockito.java`.

Both Mill and Gradle are able to take advantage of the small code change and re-compile
only the single files needing re-compilation, demonstrating substantial speedups over
the <<Clean Compile Single-Module>> benchmark above. Mill remains faster than Gradle,
showing a ~2.7x speedup for this task

=== No-Op Compile Single-Module

```bash
$ time ./gradlew :classes
0.95s
0.93s
0.94s

$ time ./mill common.compile
0.46s
0.50s
0.45s
```

This benchmark is meant to measure the pure overhead of running the build tool: given a single
module that did _not_ change, the build tool should need to do _nothing_ in response, and so
any time taken is pure overhead.

For both Mill and Gradle, we see small speedups relative to the <<Incremental Compile Single-Module>>
benchmark above, which likely comes from not having to compile any Java source files at all. Mill
remains faster than Gradle by about 2.0x.

== IDE Experience

One area that Mill does better than Gradle is providing a seamless IDE experience. For example,
consider the snippet below where we are using Gradle to configure the javac compiler options.
Due to `.gradle` files being untyped Groovy, the autocomplete and code-assist experience working
with these files is hit-or-miss, and in this case IntelliJ cannot figure out what this property is:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoGradle.png[]

Often working with build configurations feels like hitting dead ends: if you don't have
`options.compilerArgs` memorized in your head, there is literally nothing you can do in your editor to
make progress to figure out what it is or what it is used for. That leaves you googling
for answers, which can be a frustrating experience that distracts you from the task at hand.

In comparison, `.mill` files are all statically typed, and as a result IntelliJ is easily able to
pull up the documentation for `def javacOptions`, even though it doesn't have any special support
for Mill built into the IDE:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillJavacOptionsDocs.png[]

Apart from static typing, the way Mill builds are structured also helps the IDE. For example, Mill
uses normal object-oriented inheritance and overrides to configure your builds. While that sounds
academic, one concrete consequence is that IntelliJ is able to take your configuration override and
find the original definitions that were overridden, and show you where they are defined:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillJavacOptionsParents.png[]

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillJavacOptionsDef.png[]

Furthermore, because task dependencies in Mill are just normal method calls, IntelliJ is
able to _find usages_, and you can find where the task is used. Below, we can see the method
call in the `def compile` task, which uses `javacOptions()` along with a number of other tasks:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillCompile.png[]

From there, if you are curious about any of the other tasks used alongside `javacOptions`, it's
easy for you to pull up _their_ documentation, jump to _their_
definition, or find _their_ usages. For example `compileClasspath()` below:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillCompileClasspath.png[]

Unlike most other build tools, Mill builds are extremely easy to explore interactively in your
IDE. If you do not know what something does, it's documentation, definition, or usages is always
one click away in IntelliJ or VSCode. That's not to say Mill builds aren't complex - as
we saw above, compilation has to deal with upstream outputs, classpaths, flags, reporters, and so on -
but at least in Mill your IDE can help you explore, understand and manage the complexity in a way
that no other build tool supports.

Note that the IDE experience that Mill provides should already be very familiar to anyone writing
Java, Kotlin, or Scala:

* _of course_ you can find the overridden definitions!
* _of course_ you can pull up the documentation in a click!
* _of course_ you can navigate around the codebase with your IDE to see who calls who!

What Mill provides isn't rocket science, but rather it is just about taking your existing experience
and existing IDE tooling working with application codebases, and lets you use it to manage your build
system as well.

Mill IDE support isn't perfect - you may have noticed the spurious red squigglies above - but it's
already better than most other build systems like Gradle or Maven. And that is with approximately
~zero custom integrations with the various IDEs: with some additional work, we can expect the Mill
IDE experience to improve even more over time.

== Debugging Tooling

Another area that Mill does better than Gradle is providing builtin tools for you to understand
what your build is doing. For example, the Mockito project build discussed has 22 submodules
and associated test suites, but how do these different modules depend on each other? With
Mill, you can run `./mill visualize __.compile`, and it will show you how the
`compile` task of each module depends on the others:

image::comparisons/MockitoCompileGraph.svg[]

Apart from the static dependency graph, another thing of interest may be the performance
profile and timeline: where the time is spent when you actually compile everything. With
Mill, when you run a compilation using `./mill -j 10 __.compile`, you automatically get a
`out/mill-chrome-profile.json` file that you can load into your `chrome://tracing` page and
visualize where your build is spending time and where the performance bottlenecks are:

image::comparisons/MockitoCompileProfile.png[]

If you want to inspect the tree of third-party dependencies used by any module, the
built in `ivyDepsTree` command lets you do that easily:

```bash
$ ./mill subprojects.junit-jupiter.ivyDepsTree
├─ org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.10.3
│  ├─ org.apiguardian:apiguardian-api:1.1.2
│  ├─ org.junit.platform:junit-platform-commons:1.10.3
│  │  └─ org.apiguardian:apiguardian-api:1.1.2
│  └─ org.opentest4j:opentest4j:1.3.0
└─ org.objenesis:objenesis:3.3
```

None of these tools are rocket science, but Mill provides all of them out of the
box in a convenient package for you to use. Whether you want a visual graph layout,
a parallel performance profile, or a third-party dependency tree of your project,
Mill makes it easy and convenient without needing to fiddle with custom configuration
or third party plugins. This helps make it easy for you to explore, understand, and
take ownership of the build tool.

== Conclusion


Both the Mill and Gradle builds we discussed in this case study do the same thing: they
compile Java code and run tests. Sometimes they perform additional configuration, tweaking
JVM arguments or doing ad-hoc classpath mangling.

In general, building projects with Mill is significantly faster than Gradle, but the gap
is not as big as when comparing xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[Mill v.s. Maven]. Mill builds
do all the same things as gradle builds, and need to manage the same kind of complexity.
But where Mill shines over Gradle is just the understandability of the build: while Gradle is
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25801986[famously confusing and opaque], Mill's great
IDE support allows the user to explore, understand, and manage their build as easily as
any application codebase, entirely different from the typical experience managing Gradle
scripts.

Again, the Mill build used in this comparison is for demonstration purposes, and more
work would be necessary to make the Mill build production ready: publishing configuration,
code coverage integration, and so on. However, hopefully it demonstrates the potential value,
and convinces you to give it a try!
