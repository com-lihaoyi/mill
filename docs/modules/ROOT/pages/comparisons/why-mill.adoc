= Why Mill?

Mill is a fast build tool for Java, Scala, and Kotlin. Although the Java
compiler is very fast and the Java language is easy to learn, JVM build tools are
known to be slow and hard to use. Mill offers a better alternative: 2-10x faster
than Maven or Gradle on clean compiles, better IDE support, and extensibility without
needing plugins. This results in time savings due to less time waiting for or struggling
with your build tool and more time to focus on the actual work you need to do.

At a first glance, Mill looks like any other build tool. You have build files, you configure
dependencies, you can compile, run, or test your project:

```scala
// build.mill
package build
import mill._, javalib._

object foo extends JavaModule {
  def ivyDeps = Agg(
    ivy"net.sourceforge.argparse4j:argparse4j:0.9.0",
    ivy"org.thymeleaf:thymeleaf:3.1.1.RELEASE"
  )

  object test extends JavaTests with TestModule.Junit4
}
```
```bash
> /mill foo.compile
compiling 1 Java source...

> /mill foo.run --text hello
<h1>hello</h1>

> ./mill foo.test
Test foo.FooTest.testEscaping finished, ...
Test foo.FooTest.testSimple finished, ...
0 failed, 0 ignored, 2 total, ...
```

Beyond the basics, Mill provides 3 major advantages over other build tools. The comparison pages
for the respective build tool go into more detail (for xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[Maven],
xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc[Gradle], and xref:comparisons/sbt.adoc[SBT]), but at a high level
these advantages are:

1. *Performance*: Mill offers a 2-10x speedup means less time waiting for your build tool,
   meaning less time waiting for your build and more time doing useful work

2. *Ease of Use*: Mill has better IDE support in IntelliJ and VSCode and richer
   visualization tools than other tools, to help understand your build and what it is doing

3. *Extensibility*: Mill lets you write code or use any published JVM library in your build,
   customizing it to your needs without being limited by third-party plugins

We will discuss each one in turn.

## Performance

### Maven

Overall across our benchmarks, Mill is 4-10x faster than Maven for clean compiles,
both parallel and sequential, and for many modules or for a single module:

|===
| Benchmark | Maven | Mill | Speedup
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_sequential_clean_compile_all[Sequential Clean Compile All] | 1m 38.80s | 23.14s | 4.3x
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_parallel_clean_compile_all[Parallel Clean Compile All] | 0m 48.92s | 0m 08.79s | 5.6x
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_clean_compile_single_module[Clean Compile Single Module] | 0m 08.46s | 0m 01.94s | 4.4x
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_incremental_compile_single_module[Incremental Compile Single Module] | 0m 06.82s | 0m 00.54s | 12.6x
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_no_op_compile_single_module[No-Op Compile Single Module] | 0m 05.25s | 0m 00.47s  | 11.2x
|===

For this article, we will focus on two benchmarks

#### Parallel Clean Compile All

|===
| Benchmark | Maven | Mill | Speedup
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_parallel_clean_compile_all[Parallel Clean Compile All] | 0m 48.92s | 0m 08.79s | 5.6x
|===


```bash
> time ./mvnw -T 10 -DskipTests  -Dcheckstyle.skip -Denforcer.skip=true clean install

> ./mill clean; time ./mill __.compile
```


This benchmark involves running `clean` to delete all generated files and re-compiling
everything in parallel.

* For Maven, parallelism is opt-in via `-T 10`, while for Mill it is enabled by default.
* For Maven, tests and linters are opt-out via the `-D` properties, while in Mill
  tests and linters are opt-in

Mill sees a significant ~6x speedup over Maven for this benchmark.

#### Incremental Compile Single-Module

|===
| Benchmark | Maven | Mill | Speedup
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_incremental_compile_single_module[Incremental Compile Single Module] | 0m 06.82s | 0m 00.54s | 12.6x
|===

```bash
$ echo "" >> common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/AbstractConstant.java
$ time ./mvnw -pl common -DskipTests  -Dcheckstyle.skip -Denforcer.skip=true install
Compiling 174 source files to /Users/lihaoyi/Github/netty/common/target/classes
Compiling 60 source files to /Users/lihaoyi/Github/netty/common/target/test-classes


$ echo "" >> common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/AbstractConstant.java
$ time ./mill common.test.compile
compiling 1 Java source to /Users/lihaoyi/Github/netty/out/common/compile.dest/classes ...
```

This benchmark involves making a single edit to a single already-compiled file in `common` -
adding a single newline to the end of the file - and re-compiling `common` and `common.test`.

Mill sees a huge ~12x speedup for this benchmark, because Mill's incremental compiler
(https://github.com/sbt/zinc[Zinc]) is able to detect that only one file in one module
has changed, and that the change is small enough
to not require other files to re-compile. In contrast, Maven re-compiles all files in both
modules, even though only one file was touched and the change was trivial.


### Gradle

The comparison with Gradle is less stark, but still significant. Mill is 3-4x faster than Gradle
across the various workflows:


|===
| Benchmark | Gradle | Mill | Speedup
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_sequential_clean_compile_all[Sequential Clean Compile All] | 17.6s | 5.40s | 3.3x
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_parallel_clean_compile_all[Parallel Clean Compile All] | 12.3s | 3.57s | 3.4x
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_clean_compile_single_module[Clean Compile Single Module] | 4.41s | 1.20s | 3.7x
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_incremental_compile_single_module[Incremental Compile Single Module] | 1.37s | 0.51s | 2.7x
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_no_op_compile_single_module[No-Op Compile Single Module] | 0.94s | 0.46s | 2.0x
|===

Again, for the purposes of this article, we will focus on two benchmarks

#### Parallel Clean Compile All

|===
| Benchmark | Gradle | Mill | Speedup
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_parallel_clean_compile_all[Parallel Clean Compile All] | 12.3s | 3.57s | 3.4x
|===

```bash
$ ./gradlew clean; time ./gradlew classes testClasses --no-build-cache

$ ./mill clean; time ./mill __.compile
```

Here we only run compilation for classes and test classes, without linting or testing or anything else.
Both Mill and Gradle are parallel by default, with 1 thread per core. For Gradle we disabled the global
build cache to ensure we can benchmark the actual compilation time.

We measure Mill being ~3.4x faster than Gradle for this benchmark.

#### Incremental Compile Single-Module

|===
| Benchmark | Gradle | Mill | Speedup
| xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_incremental_compile_single_module[Incremental Compile Single Module] | 1.37s | 0.51s | 2.7x
|===

```bash
$ echo "" >> src/main/java/org/mockito/BDDMockito.java; time ./gradlew :classes

$ echo "" >> src/main/java/org/mockito/BDDMockito.java; time ./mill compile
compiling 1 Java source to /Users/lihaoyi/Github/netty/out/common/compile.dest/classes ...
```


Again, this benchmark involves making a single edit to a single already-compiled file in the
root module - adding a single newline to the end of the file - and re-compiling it along with
its tests.

Both Gradle and Mill appear to do a good job limiting the compilation to only the changed
file, but Mill has less fixed overhead than Gradle does, finishing in about ~0.5s
rather than ~1.5 seconds.


## Ease of Use

The second area that Mill does well compared to tools like Maven or Gradle is in its ease
of use.This is not just in superficial things like the build file or command-line syntax,
but also in how Mill exposes how your build works and what your build is doing so you can
understand it and confidently make changes. We will consider three cases: the Mill Chrome
Profile, Mill Visualize, and Mill's IDE support

### Chrome Profiles

All Mill runs generate some debugging metadata files in `out/mill-*`. One of these
is `out/mill-chrome-profile.json`, which is a file following the Chrome Profiling format.
It can be loaded into any Chrome browser's built in `chrome://tracing` UI, to let you
interactively explore what Mill was doing during its last run. e.g. when performing a
clean compile on the Netty codebase, the profile ends up looking like this:

image::comparisons/NettyCompileProfile.png[]

The Chrome profile shows what task each Mill thread was executing throughout the run.
The Chrome profiling UI is interactive, so you can zoom in and out, or click on individual
tasks to show the exact duration and other metadata.

But the real benefit of the Chrome profile isn't the low-level data it provides, but the
high-level view:

* In the profile above, it is clear that for the first ~700ms, Mill is able
  to use all cores on 10 cores on my laptop to do useful work.
* But after that, utilization is
  much more sparse: `common.compile`, `buffer.compile`, `transport.compile`, `codec.compile`,
  appear to wait for one another and run sequentially one after another.


This waiting is likely due to dependencies between them, and they take long enough that all
the other tasks depending on them get held up. For example, when `codec.compile` finishes
above, we can see a number of downstream tasks immediately start running.

This understanding of your build's performance profile is not just an academic exercise, but
provides actionable information:

* If I wanted faster Netty clean compiles, speeding up `common.compile`, `buffer.compile`,
  `transport.compile`, or `codec.compile` would make the most impact.

* On the other hand, time speeding up the various `codec-*.compile` tasks would help not at all:
  these tasks are already running at a time where the CPUs are mostly idle.

Most build tools do provide some way of analyzing build performance, but none of them provide
it as easily as Mill does: any Mill run generates a profile automatically, and any computer
with Chrome on it is able to load and let you explore that profile. That is a powerful tool to
help engineers understand what the build is doing: any engineer who felt a build was slow
can trivially load it into their Chrome browser to analyze and figure out what.

### Mill Visualize

Apart from the Mill Chrome Profile, Mill also provides the `./mill visualize` command, which
is useful to show the logical dependency graph between tasks. For example, we can use
`./mill visualize __.compile` (double underscore means wildcard) to
show the dependency graph between the modules of the Netty build below:

image::comparisons/NettyCompileGraph.svg[]

(_Right-click open-image-in-new-tab to see full size_)

In this graph, we can clearly see that `common.compile`, `buffer.compile`,`transport.compile`,
and `codec.compile` depend on each other in a linear fashion. This explains why they each must
wait for the prior task to complete before starting, and cannot run in parallel with one another.
Furthermore, we can again confirm that many of the `codec-*.compile` tasks depend on `codec.compile`,
which is in the profile why we saw them waiting for the upstream task to complete before starting.

Although these are things we could have _guessed_ from looking at the Chrome Profile above,
`./mill visualize` gives you a separate angle from which to look at your build. Together these
tools can help give greater understanding of what your build is doing and why it is doing that:
something that can be hard to come by with build tools that are often considered confusing and
inscrutable.

### IDE Support

One area that Mill does better than Gradle is providing a seamless IDE experience. For example,
consider the snippet below where we are using Gradle to configure the javac compiler options.
Due to `.gradle` files being untyped Groovy, the autocomplete and code-assist experience working
with these files is hit-or-miss. In the example below, we can see that IntelliJ is able to identify
that `compileArgs` exists and has the type `List<String>`:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoGradleCompileOptions.png[]

But if you try to jump to definition or find out anything else about it you hit a wall:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoGradleCompileOptions2.png[]

Often working with build configurations feels like hitting dead ends: if you don't have
`options.compilerArgs` memorized in your head, there is literally nothing you can do in your editor to
make progress to figure out what it is or what it is used for. That leaves you googling
for answers, which can be a frustrating experience that distracts you from the task at hand.

The fundamental problem with tools like Gradle is that the code you write does not
actually perform the build: rather, you are just setting up some data structure that
is used to configure the _real_ build engine that runs later. Thus when you explore
the Gradle build in an IDE, the IDE can only explore the configuration logic (which
is usually un-interesting) and is unable to explore the actual build logic (which
is what you actually care about!)

In comparison, Mill's `.mill` files are all statically typed, and as a result IntelliJ is easily able to
pull up the documentation for `def javacOptions`, even though it doesn't have any special support
for Mill built into the IDE:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillJavacOptionsDocs.png[]

Apart from static typing, the way Mill builds are structured also helps the IDE: Mill
code _actually performs your build_, rather than configuring some opaque build engine.
While that sounds academic, one concrete consequence is that IntelliJ is able to take
your `def javacOptions` override and
find the original definitions that were overridden, and show you where they are defined:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillJavacOptionsParents.png[]

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillJavacOptionsDef.png[]

Furthermore, because task dependencies in Mill are just normal method calls, IntelliJ is
able to _find usages_, showing you where the task is used. Below, we can see the method
call in the `def compile` task, which uses `javacOptions()` along with a number of other tasks:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillCompile.png[]

From there, if you are curious about any of the other tasks used alongside `javacOptions`, it's
easy for you to pull up _their_ documentation, jump to _their_
definition, or find _their_ usages. For example we can pull up the docs of

`compileClasspath()` below, jump to _its_ implementation, and continue
interactively exploring your build logic:

image::comparisons/IntellijMockitoMillCompileClasspath.png[]

Unlike most other build tools, Mill builds can be explored interactively in your
IDE. If you do not know what something does, it's documentation, definition, or usages is always
one click away in IntelliJ or VSCode. This isn't a new experience for Java developers, as it
is what you would be used to day-to-day in your application code! But Mill brings that same
polished experience to your build system - traditionally something that has been opaque
and hard to understand - and does so in a way that no other build tool does.


## Extensibility

Mill allows you to directly write code to configure your build, and even download libraries
from Maven Central.

Most build tools need plugins to do anything: if you want to Foo you need a
Foo plugin, if you want to Bar you need a Bar plugin, for any possible Foo or Bar. These could
be simple tasks - zipping up files, pre-rendering web templates, preparing static assets for
deployment - but even a tasks that would be trivial to implement in a few lines of code requires
you to Google for third-party plugins, dig through their Github to see which one is best
maintained, and hope for the best when you include it in your build. And while you could
write plugins yourself, doing so is usually challenging and non-trivial.

Mill is different. Although it does have plugins for more advanced integrations, for most
simple things you can directly write code to achieve what you want, using the bundled
filesystem, subprocess, and dependency-management libraries. And even if you need third-party
libraries from Maven Central to do Foo, you can directly import the "Foo" library and use it
directly, without having to find a "Foo build plugin" wrapper.

### Simple Custom Tasks

The following Mill build is a minimal Java module `foo`. It contains no custom configuration, and
so inherits all the defaults from `mill.javalib.JavaModule`: default source folder layout, default
assembly configuration, default compiler flags, and so on.

```scala
package build
import mill._, javalib._

object foo extends JavaModule {
}
```
```bash
> mill compile
Compiling 1 Java source...
```

If you want to add a custom task, this is as simple as defining a method e.g.
`def lineCount = Task { ... }`. The body of `Task` performs the action we want, and
can depend on other tasks such as `allSourceFiles()` below:

```scala
package build
import mill._, javalib._

object foo extends JavaModule {
  /** Total number of lines in module source files */
  def lineCount = Task {
    allSourceFiles().map(f => os.read.lines(f.path).size).sum
  }
}
```

Once we define a new task, we can immediately begin using it in our build.
`lineCount` is not used by any existing `JavaModule` tasks, but we can still
show its value via the Mill command line to force it to evaluate:

```bash
> mill show foo.lineCount
17
```

Note that as `lineCount` is a `Task`, we get automatic caching, invalidation, and
parallelization: these are things that every `Task` gets for free, without the task
author to do anything. And although we wrote the `lineCount` logic in the main
`build.mill` file for this example, if it grows complex enough to get messy it is
easy to move it to your own xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc[custom plugins]

### Overriding Tasks

To wire up `lineCount` into our main `JavaModule` `compile`/`test`/`run` tasks,
one way is to take the line count value and write it to a file in `def resources`.
This file can then be read at runtime as a JVM resource. We do that below
by overriding `def resources` and making it depend on `lineCount`, in addition
to its existing value `super.resources()`:

```scala
package build
import mill._, javalib._

object foo extends JavaModule {
  /** Total number of lines in module source files */
  def lineCount = Task {
    allSourceFiles().map(f => os.read.lines(f.path).size).sum
  }

  /** Generate resources using lineCount of sources */
  override def resources = Task {
    os.write(Task.dest / "line-count.txt", "" + lineCount())
    super.resources() ++ Seq(PathRef(Task.dest))
  }
}
```


Because `override def resources` overrides the existing `resources` method used
in the rest of `JavaModule`, the downstream tasks automatically now use the new
override instead, as that is how overrides work. That means if you call `mill foo.run`,
it will automatically pick up the new `line-count.txt` file and make it available to
the application code to use e.g. below, where we just print it out:

```bash
> mill foo.run
Line Count: 18
```

Most developers do not need to embed the line-count of their codebase in a resource
file to look up at runtime, but nevertheless this example shows how easy it is to write
code to perform ad-hoc tasks without needing to pull in and configure some third-party
plugin. And we get full IDE support with autocomplete/navigation/documentation/etc.
while we are writing our custom task.


While most build tools do allow writing and wiring up custom tasks, none of them
have a workflow as simple as Mill. Next, we'll look at a more realistic example,
which includes usage of third-party libraries in the build.

### Using Libraries from Maven Central in Tasks

Earlier on we discussed possibly pre-rendering HTML pages in the build so they can be
served at runtime. The use case for this are obvious: if a page never changes, rendering
it on every request is wasteful, and even rendering it once and then caching it can impact
your application startup time. Thus, you may want to move some HTML rendering to build-time,
but with traditional build tools such a move is sufficiently inconvenient and complicated
that people do not do it.

With Mill, pre-rendering HTML at build time is really easy, even if you need a third-party
library. Mill does not ship with a bundled HTML templating engine, but you can use the
`import $ivy` syntax to include one such as Thymeleaf, which would immediately make the
Thymeleaf classes available for you to import and use in your build as below:


```scala
package build
import mill._, javalib._
import $ivy.`org.thymeleaf:thymeleaf:3.1.1.RELEASE`
import org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine
import org.thymeleaf.context.Context
object foo extends JavaModule {
  def htmlSnippet = Task {
    val context = new Context()
    context.setVariable("heading", "hello")
    new TemplateEngine().process(
        "<h1 th:text=\"${heading}\"></h1>",
        context
    )
  }
  def resources = Task.Sources{
    os.write(Task.dest / "snippet.txt", htmlSnippet())
    super.resources() ++ Seq(PathRef(Task.dest))
  }
}
```

Once we have run `import $ivy`, we can import `TemplateEngine`, `Context`, and replace our
`def lineCount` with a `def htmlSnippet` task that uses Thymeleaf to render  HTML. Again,
we get full IDE support for working with the Thymeleaf Java API, the new `htmlSnippet` task
is inspectable from the Mill command line via `show`, and we wire it up into
`def resources` so it can be inspected and used at runtime by the application
(in this case just printed out):


```bash
> mill show foo.htmlSnippet
"<h1>hello</h1>"

> mill foo.compile
compiling 1 Java source...
...

> mill foo.run
generated snippet.txt resource: <h1>hello</h1>
```

Rendering HTML using the Thymeleaf templating engine is not rocket science, but what is
interesting here is what we did _not_ need to do:

* We did _not_ need to find a Thymeleaf-Mill plugin in order to include Thymeleaf in our
  build

* We did _not_ need to learn a special API or framework for authoring build plugins ourselves
  to write a plugin to include Thymeleaf in our build

Instead, we could simply import Thymeleaf directly from Maven Central and use it just
like we would use it in any Java application, complete with full IDE support for
autocomplete and code navigation, with the same experience you probably are already
used to for your application code. This makes it an order of magnitude easier for
non-experts to configure their build to do exactly what they need, rather than be
limited by what some unmaintained third-party plugin might support. And although
the configuration is done in the Scala language, the syntax should be relatively
familiar ("Java without Semicolons" it is sometimes called) and the JVM libraries
and tools (e.g. Thymeleaf, IntelliJ, VSCode) are the exact same libraries and tools
you are already used to.

## Conclusion

To wrap up, Mill does all the same things that other build tools like Maven or Gradle do,
but aims to do them better: faster, easier to use, and easier to extend.
This means both time saved waiting for your build tool to run in day-to-day work, as well
as time saved when you inevitably need to evolve or adjust your build system to accommodate
changing requirements.

With Mill, you can therefore spend less time waiting for or fighting with your build tool,
and more time on the actual work you are trying to accomplish. And while traditionally build
systems were often mysterious black boxes that only experts could work with, Mill's ease
of use and ease of extension democratize the build system so any developer can figure out
what its doing or extend it to do exactly what they need.
