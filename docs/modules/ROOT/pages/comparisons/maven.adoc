= Case Study: Mill vs Maven
:page-aliases: Case_Study_Mill_vs_Maven.adoc

include::partial$gtag-config.adoc[]

Compared to Maven:


* **Mill follows Maven's innovation of good built-in defaults**: Mill's built-in
``JavaModule``s follow Maven's "convention over configuration" style, so small Mill
projects require minimal effort to get started, and larger Mill projects have a consistent
structure building on these defaults.

* **Mill automatically caches and parallelizes your build, offering 4-10x speedups**:
Not just the built-in tasks that Mill ships with, but also any custom tasks or modules.
This maximizes the snappiness of your command-line build workflows to keep you productive,
which especially matters in larger codebases where builds tend to get slow:
xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_performance[a Maven "clean install" workflow
  taking over a minute might take just a few seconds in Mill].

* **Mill makes customizing the build tool much easier than Maven**. Projects usually
grow beyond just compiling a single language: needing custom
code generation, linting workflows, tool integrations, output artifacts, or support for
additional languages. Mill's xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_extensibility_ide_experience[extensibility and IDE experience]
makes doing this yourself easy and safe, with type-checked code and
xref:depth/sandboxing.adoc[sandboxed tasks]


This page compares using Mill to Maven, using the https://github.com/netty/netty[Netty Network Server]
codebase as the example. Netty is a large, old codebase. 500,000 lines of Java, written by
over 100 contributors across 15 years, split over 47 subprojects, with over 10,000 lines of
Maven `pom.xml` configuration alone. By porting it to Mill, this case study should give you
an idea of how Mill compares to Maven in larger, real-world projects.

To do this, we have written a Mill `build.mill` file for the Netty project. This can be used
with Mill to build and test the various submodules of the Netty project without needing to
change any other files in the repository:

- https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/blob/main/example/thirdparty/netty/build.mill[Netty build.mill file]

== Completeness

The Mill build for Netty is not 100% complete, but it covers most of the major parts of Netty:
compiling Java, compiling and linking C code via JNI, running JUnit tests and some integration
tests using H2Spec. All 47 Maven subprojects are modelled using Mill, with the entire Netty codebase
being approximately 500,000 lines of code.

```bash
$ git ls-files | grep \\.java | xargs wc -l
...
513805 total
```

The goal of this exercise is not to be 100% feature complete enough to replace the Maven build
today. It is instead meant to provide a realistic comparison of how using Mill in a large,
complex project compares to using Maven.

Both Mill and Maven builds end up compiling the same set of files, although the number being
reported by the command line is slightly higher for Mill (2915 files) than Maven (2822) due
to differences in the reporting (e.g. Maven does not report `package-info.java` files as part
of the compiled file count).

== Performance

The Mill build for Netty is much more performant than the default Maven build. This applies to
most workflows.

For the benchmarks below, each provided number is the wall time of three consecutive runs
on my M1 Macbook Pro. While ad-hoc, these benchmarks are enough to give you a flavor of how
Mill's performance compares to Maven:

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
| Benchmark | Maven | Mill | Speedup

| <<Sequential Clean Compile All>> | 1m 38.80s | 23.14s | 4.3x
| <<Parallel Clean Compile All>> | 0m 48.92s | 0m 08.79s | 5.6x
| <<Clean Compile Single-Module>> | 0m 08.46s | 0m 01.94s | 4.4x
| <<Incremental Compile Single-Module>> | 0m 06.82s | 0m 00.54s | 12.6x
| <<No-Op Compile Single-Module>> | 0m 05.25s | 0m 00.47s  | 11.2x
|===

The column on the right shows the speedups of how much faster Mill is compared to the
equivalent Maven workflow. In most cases,  Mill is 4-10x faster than Maven. Below, we
will go into more detail of each benchmark: how they were run, what they mean, and how
we can explain the difference in performing the same task with the two different build tools.

=== Sequential Clean Compile All

```bash
$ ./mvnw clean; time ./mvnw -Pfast  -Dcheckstyle.skip -Denforcer.skip=true -DskipTests install
1m 38.80s
1m 36.14s
1m 39.95s

$ ./mill clean; time ./mill -j1 __.compile
0m 23.99s
0m 23.14s
0m 22.68s
```

This benchmark exercises the simple "build everything from scratch" workflow, with all remote
artifacts already in the local cache. The actual files
being compiled are the same in either case (as mentioned in the <<Completeness>> section).
I have explicitly disabled the various linters and tests for the Maven build, to just focus
on the compilation of Java source code making it an apples-to-apples comparison. As Mill
runs tasks in parallel by default, I have disabled parallelism explicitly via `-j1`

As a point of reference, Java typically compiles at 10,000-50,000 lines per second on a
single thread, and the Netty codebase is ~500,000 lines of code, so we would expect compile
to take 10-50 seconds without parallelism.
The 20-30s taken by Mill seems about what you would expect for a codebase of this size,
and the ~150s taken by Maven is far beyond what you would expect from simple Java compilation.

==== Maven Compile vs Install

In general, the reason we have to use `./mvnw install` rather than `./mvnw compile` is that
Maven's main mechanism for managing inter-module dependencies is via the local artifact cache
at `~/.m2/repository`. Although many workflows work with `compile`, some don't, and
`./mvnw clean compile` on the Netty repository fails with:

```text
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:2.10:unpack-dependencies
(unpack) on project netty-resolver-dns-native-macos: Artifact has not been packaged yet.
When used on reactor artifact, unpack should be executed after packaging: see MDEP-98. -> [Help 1]
[ERROR]
[ERROR] To see the full stack trace of the errors, re-run Maven with the -e switch.
[ERROR] Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.

[ERROR]
[ERROR] After correcting the problems, you can resume the build with the command
[ERROR]   mvn <args> -rf :netty-resolver-dns-native-macos
```

In contrast, Mill builds do not rely on the local artifact cache, even though Mill is able
to publish to it. That means Mill builds are able to work directly with classfiles on disk,
simply referencing them and using them as-is without spending time packing and unpacking them
into `.jar` files. Furthermore, even if we _did_ want Mill to generate the ``.jar``s, the
overhead of doing so is just a few seconds, far less than the two entire minutes that
Maven's overhead adds to the clean build:

```bash
$ ./mill clean; time ./mill -j1 __.jar
0m 32.58s
0m 24.90s
0m 23.35s
```

From this benchmark, we can see that although both Mill and Maven are doing the same work,
Mill takes about as long as it _should_ for this task of compiling 500,000 lines of Java source
code, while Maven takes considerably longer. And much of this overhead comes from Maven
doing unnecessary work packing/unpacking jar files and publishing to a local repository,
whereas Mill directly uses the classfiles generated on disk to bypass all that work.

=== Parallel Clean Compile All

```bash
$ ./mvnw clean; time ./mvnw -T 10 -Pfast -DskipTests  -Dcheckstyle.skip -Denforcer.skip=true install
0m 48.92s
0m 48.41s
0m 49.50s

$ ./mill clean; time ./mill __.compile
0m 09.07s
0m 08.79s
0m 07.93s
```

This example compares Maven v.s. Mill, when performing the clean build on 10 threads.
Both build tools support parallelism (`-T 10` in Maven, by default in Mill), and both
tools see a similar ~2x speedup for building the Netty project using 4 threads. Again,
this tests a clean build using `./mvnw clean` or `./mill clean`.

This comparison shows that much of Mill's speedup over Maven is unrelated to parallelism.
Whether sequential or parallel, Mill has approximately the same ~7x speedup over Maven
when performing a clean build of the Netty repository.

=== Clean Compile Single-Module

```bash
$ ./mvnw clean; time ./mvnw -pl common -Pfast -DskipTests  -Dcheckstyle.skip -Denforcer.skip=true install
0m 08.46s
0m 08.90s
0m 08.30s

$ ./mill clean common; time ./mill common.test.compile
0m 01.99s
0m 01.81s
0m 01.94s
```

This exercise limits the comparison to compiling a single module, in this case `common/`.
`./mvnw -pl common install` compiles both the `main/` and `test/` sources, whereas
`./mill common.compile` would only compile the `main/` sources, and we need to explicitly
reference `common.test.compile` to compile both (because `common.test.compile` depends on
`common.compile`, `common.compile` gets run automatically)

Again, we can see a significant speedup of Mill v.s. Maven remains even when compiling a
single module: a clean compile of `common/` is about 9x faster with Mill than with Maven!
Again, `common/` is about 40,000 lines of Java source code, so at 10,000-50,000 lines per
second we would expect it to compile in about 1-4s. That puts Mill's compile times right
at what you would expect, whereas Maven's has a significant overhead.


=== Incremental Compile Single-Module

```bash
$ echo "" >> common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/AbstractConstant.java
$ time ./mvnw -pl common -Pfast -DskipTests  -Dcheckstyle.skip -Denforcer.skip=true install
Compiling 174 source files to /Users/lihaoyi/Github/netty/common/target/classes
Compiling 60 source files to /Users/lihaoyi/Github/netty/common/target/test-classes

0m 06.89s
0m 06.34s
0m 06.82s


$ echo "" >> common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/AbstractConstant.java
$ time ./mill common.test.compile
compiling 1 Java source to /Users/lihaoyi/Github/netty/out/common/compile.dest/classes ...

0m 00.78s
0m 00.54s
0m 00.51s
```

This benchmark explores editing a single file and re-compiling `common/`.

Maven by default takes about as long to re-compile ``common/``s `main/` and `test/` sources
after a single-line edit as it does from scratch, about 20 seconds. However, Mill
takes just about 0.5s to compile and be done! Looking at the logs, we can see it is
because Mill only compiles the single file we changed, and not the others.

For this incremental compilation, Mill uses the
https://github.com/sbt/zinc[Zinc Incremental Compiler]. Zinc is able to analyze the dependencies
between files to figure out what needs to re-compile: for an internal change that doesn't
affect downstream compilation (e.g. changing a string literal) Zinc only needs to compile
the file that changed, taking barely half a second:

```diff
$ git diff
diff --git a/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/AbstractConstant.java b/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/AbstractConstant.java

```bash
$ time ./mill common.test.compile

In contrast, a change to a class or function public signature (e.g. adding a method) may
require downstream code to re-compile, and we can see that below:

```diff
$ git diff
diff --git a/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/AbstractConstant.java b/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/AbstractConstant.java

0m 00.81s2
```

Here, we can see that Zinc ended up re-compiling 7 files in `common/src/main/` and 3 files
in `common/src/test/` as a result of adding a method to `AbstractConstant.java`.

In general, Zinc is conservative, and does not always end up selecting the minimal set of
files that need re-compiling: e.g. in the above example, the new method `name2` does not
interfere with any existing method, and the ~9 downstream files did not actually need to
be re-compiled! However, even conservatively re-compiling 9 files is much faster than
Maven blindly re-compiling all 234 files, and as a result the iteration loop of
editing-compiling-testing your Java projects in Mill can be much faster than doing
the same thing in Maven

=== No-Op Compile Single-Module

```bash
$ time ./mvnw -pl common -Pfast -DskipTests  -Dcheckstyle.skip -Denforcer.skip=true install
0m 05.08s
0m 05.25s
0m 05.26s

$ time ./mill common.test.compile
0m 00.49s
0m 00.47s
0m 00.45s
```

This last benchmark explores the boundaries of Maven and Mill: what happens if
we ask to compile a single module _that has already been compiled_? In this case,
there is literally _nothing to do_. For Maven, "doing nothing" takes ~17 seconds,
whereas for Mill we can see it complete and return in less than 0.5 seconds

Grepping the logs, we can confirm that both build tools skip re-compilation of the
`common/` source code. In Maven, skipping compilation only saves us ~2 seconds,
bringing down the 19s we saw in <<Clean Compile Single-Module>> to 17s here. This
matches what we expect about Java compilation speed, with the 2s savings on
40,000 lines of code telling us Java compiles at ~20,000 lines per second. However,
we still see Maven taking *17 entire seconds* before it can decide to do nothing!

In contrast, doing the same no-op compile using Mill, we see the timing from 2.2s
in <<Clean Compile Single-Module>> to 0.5 seconds here. This is the same ~2s reduction
we saw with Maven, but due to Mill's minimal overhead, in the end the command
finishes in less than half a second.


== Extensibility & IDE Experience

Even though Maven is designed to be declarative, in many real-world codebases you end
up needing to run ad-hoc scripts and logic. This section will explore two such scenarios,
so you can see how Mill differs from Maven in the handling of these requirements.

=== JVM Libraries: Groovy

The Maven build for the `common/` subproject
uses a Groovy script for code generation. This is configured via:

```xml
<properties>
  <collection.template.dir>${project.basedir}/src/main/templates</collection.template.dir>
  <collection.template.test.dir>${project.basedir}/src/test/templates</collection.template.test.dir>
  <collection.src.dir>${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/collections/java</collection.src.dir>
  <collection.testsrc.dir>${project.build.directory}/generated-test-sources/collections/java</collection.testsrc.dir>
</properties>
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.codehaus.gmaven</groupId>
  <artifactId>groovy-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.1</version>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.groovy</groupId>
      <artifactId>groovy</artifactId>
      <version>3.0.9</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>ant</groupId>
      <artifactId>ant-optional</artifactId>
      <version>1.5.3-1</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>generate-collections</id>
      <phase>generate-sources</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>execute</goal>
      </goals>
      <configuration>
        <source>${project.basedir}/src/main/script/codegen.groovy</source>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

In contrast, the Mill build configures the code generation as follows:

```scala
import $ivy.`org.codehaus.groovy:groovy:3.0.9`
import $ivy.`org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-ant:3.0.9`
import $ivy.`ant:ant-optional:1.5.3-1`

object common extends NettyModule{
  ...
  def script = Task.Source(millSourcePath / "src" / "main" / "script")
  def generatedSources0 = Task {
    val shell = new groovy.lang.GroovyShell()
    val context = new java.util.HashMap[String, Object]

    context.put("collection.template.dir", "common/src/main/templates")
    context.put("collection.template.test.dir", "common/src/test/templates")
    context.put("collection.src.dir", (T.dest / "src").toString)
    context.put("collection.testsrc.dir", (T.dest / "testsrc").toString)

    shell.setProperty("properties", context)
    shell.setProperty("ant", new groovy.ant.AntBuilder())

    shell.evaluate((script().path / "codegen.groovy").toIO)

    (PathRef(T.dest / "src"), PathRef(T.dest / "testsrc"))
  }

  def generatedSources = Task { Seq(generatedSources0()._1)}
}
```

While the number of lines of code _written_ is not that different, the Mill configuration
is a lot more direct: rather than writing 35 lines of XML to configure an opaque third-party
plugin, we instead write 25 lines of code to directly do what we want: import `groovy`,
configure a `GroovyShell`, and use it to evaluate our `codegen.groovy` script. Although
you may not be familiar with the Scala language that Mill builds are written in, you could
probably skim the snippet above and guess what it is doing, and guess correctly.

This direct control means you are not beholden to third party plugins: rather than being
limited to what an existing plugin _allows_ you to do, Mill allows you to directly write
the code necessary to do what _you need to do_. In this case, if we need to invoke
https://github.com/apache/groovy[Groovy] and
https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core/blob/4c05980922a927b32691e4c3eba5633825cc01e3/subprojects/groovy-ant/src/spec/doc/groovy-ant-task.adoc[Groovy-Ant],
Mill allows us to direct xref:extending/import-ivy-plugins.adoc[import $ivy] the relevant
JVM artifacts from Maven Central and begin using them in our build code in a safe,
strongly-typed fashion, with full autocomplete and code assistance:

image::comparisons/IntellijNettyAutocomplete.png[]

Mill gives you the full power of the JVM ecosystem to use in your build: any Java library
on Maven central is just an `import $ivy` away, and can be used with the full IDE support
and tooling experience you are used to in the JVM ecosystem.

=== Subprocesses: Make

The Maven build for the `transport-native-unix-common/` subproject needs to call
`make` in order to compile its C code to modules that can be loaded into Java applications
via JNI. Maven does this via the `maven-dependency-plugin` and `maven-antrun-plugin` which are
approximately configured as below:

```xml
<properties>
  <exe.make>make</exe.make>
  <exe.compiler>gcc</exe.compiler>
  <exe.archiver>ar</exe.archiver>
  <nativeLibName>libnetty-unix-common</nativeLibName>
  <nativeIncludeDir>${project.basedir}/src/main/c</nativeIncludeDir>
  <jniUtilIncludeDir>${project.build.directory}/netty-jni-util/</jniUtilIncludeDir>
  <nativeJarWorkdir>${project.build.directory}/native-jar-work</nativeJarWorkdir>

          </target>
        </configuration>
      </execution>
    </executions>

</plugins>
```

The `maven-dependency-plugin` is used to download and unpack a single `jar` file,
while `maven-antrun-plugin` is used to call `make`. Both are configured via XML,
with the `make` command essentially being a bash script wrapped in layers of XML.

In contrast, the Mill configuration for this logic is as follows:

```scala
def makefile = Task.Source(millSourcePath / "Makefile")
def cSources = Task.Source(millSourcePath / "src" / "main" / "c")
def cHeaders = Task {
  for(p <- os.walk(cSources().path) if p.ext == "h"){
    os.copy(p, T.dest / p.relativeTo(cSources().path), createFolders = true)
  }
  PathRef(T.dest)
}

def make = Task {
  os.copy(makefile().path, T.dest / "Makefile")
  os.copy(cSources().path, T.dest / "src" / "main" / "c", createFolders = true)

  val Seq(sourceJar) = resolveDeps(
    deps = Task.Anon(Agg(ivy"io.netty:netty-jni-util:0.0.9.Final").map(bindDependency())),
    sources = true
  )().toSeq

  os.proc("jar", "xf", sourceJar.path).call(cwd = T.dest  / "src" / "main" / "c")

  os.proc("make").call(
    cwd = T.dest,
    env = Map(
      "CC" -> "clang",
      "AR" -> "ar",
      "JNI_PLATFORM" -> "darwin",
      "LIB_DIR" -> "lib-out",
      "OBJ_DIR" -> "obj-out",
      "MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET" -> "10.9",
      "CFLAGS" -> Seq(
        "-mmacosx-version-min=10.9", "-O3", "-Werror", "-Wno-attributes", "-fPIC",

digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  makefile -> make
  cSources -> make
  cSources -> cHeaders
}
```

In Mill, we define the `makefile`, `cSources`, `cHeaders`, and `make` tasks. The bulk
of the logic is in `def make`, which prepares the `makefile` and C sources,
resolves the `netty-jni-util` source jar and unpacks it with `jar xf`, and calls `make`
with the given environment variables. Both `cHeaders` and the output of `make` are used
in downstream modules. In this case, `make` is a command-line utility rather than a JVM
library, so rather than importing it from Maven Central we use `os.proc.call` to invoke it.

Again, the Maven XML and Mill code contains exactly the same logic, and neither is
much more concise or verbose than the other. Rather, what is interesting is that
it is much easier to work with this kind of _build logic_ via _concise type-checked code_,
rather than configuring a bunch of third-party plugins to try and achieve what you want.
With Mill, you get your full IDE experience working with your build: autocomplete, code
assistance, navigation, and so on. Although working with the `os.proc.call` subprocess API
is not as right as working with the JVM libraries we saw earlier, it is still a much
richer experience than you typically get configuring XML files:

== Debugging Tooling

Another area that Mill does better than Maven is providing builtin tools for you to understand
what your build is doing. For example, the Netty project build discussed has 47 submodules
and associated test suites, but how do these different modules depend on each other? With
Mill, you can run `./mill visualize __.compile`, and it will show you how the
`compile` task of each module depends on the others (right-click open-image-in-new-tab to see
at full size):

Apart from the static dependency graph, another thing of interest may be the performance
profile and timeline: where the time is spent when you actually compile everything. With
Mill, when you run a compilation using `./mill __.compile`, you automatically get a
`out/mill-chrome-profile.json` file that you can load into your `chrome://tracing` page and
visualize where your build is spending time and where the performance bottlenecks are:

If you want to inspect the tree of third-party dependencies used by any module, the
built in `ivyDepsTree` command lets you do that easily:

```bash
$ ./mill handler.ivyDepsTree
├─ org.jctools:jctools-core:4.0.5
├─ org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.9.0
│  ├─ org.apiguardian:apiguardian-api:1.1.2
│  ├─ org.junit.platform:junit-platform-commons:1.9.0
│  │  └─ org.apiguardian:apiguardian-api:1.1.2
│  └─ org.opentest4j:opentest4j:1.2.0
└─ com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:2.6.1
```

None of these tools are rocket science, but Mill provides all of them out of the
box in a convenient package for you to use. Whether you want a visual graph layout,
a parallel performance profile, or a third-party dependency tree of your project,
Mill makes it easy and convenient without needing to fiddle with custom configuration
or third party plugins. This helps make it easy for you to explore, understand, and
take ownership of the build tool.

== Conclusion

Both the Mill and Maven builds we discussed in this case study do the same thing: they
compile Java code, zip them into Jar files, run tests. Sometimes they compile and link
C code or run `make` or Groovy.

Mill doesn't try to do _more_ than Maven does, but it
tries to do it _better_: faster compiles, shorter and easier to read configs, easier
extensibility via libraries (e.g. `org.codehaus.groovy:groovy`) and subprocesses
(e.g. `make`), better IDE support for working with your build.

Again, the Mill build used in this comparison is for demonstration purposes, and more
work would be necessary to make the Mill build production ready: compatibility with
different operating system architectures, Java versions, and so on. However, hopefully
it demonstrates the potential value: greatly improved performance, easy extensibility,
and a much better IDE experience for working with your build.
Mill provides builtin tools to help you navigate,
visualize, and understand your build, turning a normally opaque "build config" into
something that's transparent and easily understandable.
