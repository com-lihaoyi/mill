This page will discuss common topics around maintaining the code quality of Scala
codebases using the Mill build tool


== Linting and Autofixing with Scalafix

Scalafix is a tool that analyzes your Scala source code, performing intelligent analyses and
code quality checks, and is often able to automatically fix the issues that it discovers.
It can also perform automated refactoring.

Mill supports Scalafix through the Mill-Scalafix third party module. See the module documentation
for more details:

* https://github.com/joan38/mill-scalafix

== Linting with Acyclic Files Enforcement

== Autoformatting with ScalaFmt

include::example/scalalib/linting/1-scalafmt.adoc[]

== Code Coverage with Scoverage

include::example/scalalib/linting/2-contrib-scoverage.adoc[]

Mill supports Scala code coverage analysis via the Scoverage contrib plugin. See the
contrib plugin documentation for more details:
