== Publishing to other repositories

While Sonatype Maven Central is the default publish repository for JVM ecosystem projects,
there are also others that you can use. Mill supports these largely through contrib plugins:

* xref:contrib/codeartifact.adoc[]
* xref:contrib/artifactory.adoc[]
* xref:contrib/bintray.adoc[]
