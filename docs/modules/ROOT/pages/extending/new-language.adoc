= Support for New Languages

include::partial$gtag-config.adoc[]

This section walks through the process of adding support for a new programming
language to Mill. We will be adding a small `trait TypeScriptModule` with the
ability to resolve dependencies, typecheck local code, and optimize a final
bundle.

The TypeScript integration here is not intended for production usage, but is
instead meant for illustration purposes of the techniques typically used in
implementing language toolchains.

== Re-usable TypeScriptModule

== TypeScriptModule `moduleDeps`

== NPM dependencies and bundling

As mentioned earlier, the `TypeScriptModule` examples on this page are meant for
demo purposes: to show what it looks like to add support in Mill for a new
programming language toolchain. It would take significantly more work to flesh out
the featureset and performance of `TypeScriptModule` to be usable in a real world
build. But this should be enough to get you started working with Mill to add support
to any language you need: whether it's TypeScript or some other language, most programming
language toolchains have similar concepts of `compile`, `run`, `bundle`, etc.
