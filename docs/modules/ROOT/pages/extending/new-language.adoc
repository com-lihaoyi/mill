= Support for New Languages

This section walks through the process of adding support for a new programming
language to Mill. We will be adding a small `trait TypeScriptModule` with the
ability to resolve dependencies, typecheck local code, and optimize a final
bundle.

The TypeScript integration here is not intended for production usage, but is
instead meant for illustration purposes of the techniques typically used in
implementing language toolchains.
