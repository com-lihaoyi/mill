= Example: Python Support

include::partial$gtag-config.adoc[]

This section demonstrates how to integrate `Python` support into `Mill`.
We will define a simple `PythonModule` trait that can resolve dependencies,
perform type checking on local code, and optimize the final bundle.
 
`Note`: This integration is for `educational purposes only`, showcasing common technique
used in building language toolchains, and is not intended for production use.

As mentioned, The `PythonModule` examples here demonstrate 
how to add support for a new language toolchain in Mill.
A production-ready version would require more work to enhance features and performance.
