= Running Dynamic JVM Code

include::partial$gtag-config.adoc[]

While xref:extending/import-ivy-plugins.adoc[import $ivy] is convenient,
it comes with limitations as the JVM library it imports is global to your build:

1. The library has to be resolved and downloaded before any part of your build starts.
   If your codebase is large and most parts of your build don't use that library,
   needing to download the library when working on parts that don't need it can be wasteful

2. The library can only have one version across the entire build. This can be an issue if
   you need to have multiple versions of the library used in different parts of your build.
   e.g. different parts of a large Groovy codebase may use different versions of the Groovy
   interpreter, and so the Groovy interpreter cannot be included via `import $ivy` because the
   different versions would collide.

3. The library cannot be built as part of your main build. While it is possible to build
   it as part of your xref:extending/meta-build.adoc[Meta-Build], that comes with additional
   complexity and limitations. In a large codebase, you often end up building modules that
   are shared between production deployments as well as local tooling: in such cases
   `import $ivy` is not a good fit


In scenarios where these limitations cause issues, Mill provides other ways to run arbitrary
JVM code apart from `import $ivy`.
