// This section of the docs is very much "by example": how to do this, do that,
// do this other thing, etc. We touch on a lot of topics about how Mill works,
// but we intentionally skim over them and do not go into depth: the focus is
// on end user goals and how to achieve them.
.Quick Start

* xref:Web_Build_Examples.adoc[]

// This section is all about developing a deeper understanding of specific
// topics in Mill. This is the opposite of `Quick Start` above: while we touch
// on some end-user use cases, it is only to motivate the Mill features that we
// want to present to the reader. The focus is on Mill's design and
// functionality.
