// This section of the docs is very much "by example": how to do this, do that,
// do this other thing, etc. We touch on a lot of topics about how Mill works,
// but we intentionally skim over them and do not go into depth: the focus is
// on end user goals and how to achieve them.

// every Mill user will likely encounter, and are touched upon in the various
// language-specific sections, but here we go into a deeper language-agnostic
// discussion of what these Mill features ar and how they work
