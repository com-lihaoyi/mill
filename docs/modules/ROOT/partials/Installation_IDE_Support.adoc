The standard method of installing Mill is to install a <<_bootstrap_scripts,bootstrap script>>,
similar to `./gradlew` or `./mvnw` in other build tools.
This script can determine the best version to be used by a project (e.g. by
reading a `.mill-version` or `.config/mill-version` file or a `MILL_VERSION` environment variable) and will use this exact Mill version.
If the determined Mill version is not installed locally, it will be downloaded automatically.

For all the examples in this documentation, there is a `download` link that provides
a zip file containing the full example ready to use. These examples come with a `./mill`
script you can use to immediately begin working with the project, needing only a JVM installed
globally.

[#_bootstrap_scripts]
== Bootstrap Scripts

Although the Mill example projects come with their own `./mill` bootstrap script,
you can also download it manually:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
curl -L {mill-github-url}/releases/download/{mill-last-tag}/{mill-last-tag} > mill && chmod +x mill
echo {mill-last-tag} > .mill-version
----

Downloading a `mill` bootstrap script to the root of your project repository helps make it easier for
new contributors to build your project, as they don't have to install Mill before they can start.
Anyone who wants to work with the project can simply use the `./mill` script directly.

[source,bash]
----
./mill --version
./mill __.compile # double underscore
----

In general, bootstrap scripts are the recommended way of installing Mill.
Similar to `./gradlew` or `./mvnw`, the `./mill` bootstrap script
reduces the chance of errors due to the installed version of Mill
being incompatible with the version expected by your build.
In-project bootstrap scripts are also useful for running Mill in CI/CD, ensuring
that your build server like Jenkins or Github Actions has the correct version of Mill
present to build, compile or test your code.

If you do not have an existing project, you can download a bootstrap script and
run xref:{language-small}lib/builtin-commands.adoc#_init[`./mill init`] on
to list out the various example projects and select one to download and unpack into your current
working directory.

=== `millw`

You can also use https://github.com/lefou/millw[lefou/millw] as a drop-in replacement for `mill`.
This script is a bit more advanced, and supports running on all major platforms including MS Windows.

The script supports to following sources when determining the best Mill version to use:

* `MILL_VERSION` environment variable
* `.mill-version` file in the project directory
* `.config/mill-version` file in the project directory
* if non was defined so far, it can also check for the latest available version online
* `DEFAULT_MILL_VERSION` environment variable

Using a system-wide installed `millw` is probably the robustest way to use Mill on any operating system.
It also preserves support of rather old Mill versions next to recent ones, so that updating it or switching to `millw` initially should be a no-brainer.

You can also install it on Homebrew via https://github.com/lefou/homebrew-millw[homebrew-millw]:

[source,sh]
----
brew install lefou/millw/millw
----


== IDE Support

:link-metals: https://scalameta.org/metals/

Mill supports IntelliJ and VSCode, both via the standard
https://build-server-protocol.github.io/[Build Server Protocol]

=== IntelliJ

To use Mill with IntelliJ, first ensure you have the free
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-scala[IntelliJ Scala Plugin]
installed. This is necessary as Mill build files are written in Scala,
even if you are using it to build a Java or Kotlin project.

Once you have the plugin installed, you can use IntelliJ to open any project
containing a Mill `build.mill` file, and IntelliJ will automatically load the
Mill build. This will provide support both for your application code,
as well as the code in the `build.mill`:

image::basic/IntellijApp.png[]

image::basic/IntellijBuild.png[]

If IntelliJ does not highlight the `.mill` files correctly, you can explicitly enable
it by adding `*.mill` to the `Scala` file type:

image::basic/IntellijFileTypeConfig.png[]

If you make changes to your Mill `build.mill`, you can ask Intellij to load
those updates by opening the "BSP" tab and clicking the "Refresh" button

image::basic/IntellijRefresh.png[]

==== IntelliJ IDEA XML Support

Apart from using the Build Server Protocol, you can also generate IDEA project
files directly with Mill. This is probably the preferred way if you work on
polyglot projects and need support for other languages like Kotlin or AspectJ,
which are currently not specifically configured over BSP.

To generate IntelliJ IDEA project files into `.idea/`, run:

[source,bash]
----
./mill mill.idea.GenIdea/
----

This will generate the XML files IntelliJ uses to configure your project

```
.idea
.idea/scala_settings.xml
.idea/mill_modules
.idea/mill_modules/.iml
.idea/mill_modules/mill-build.iml
.idea/mill_modules/test.iml
.idea/libraries
.idea/libraries/mill_scalalib_2_13_0_11_10_jar.xml
...
.idea/workspace.xml
.idea/modules.xml
.idea/scala_compiler.xml
.idea/misc.xml
```

After the files are generated, you can open the folder in IntelliJ to load the project
into your IDE. If you make changes to your Mill `build.mill`, you can update the project config
those updates by running `./mill mill.idea.GenIdea/` again.

=== VSCode

To use Mill with VSCode, first ensure you have the free
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals[Metals VSCode Scala language server]
installed. This is necessary as Mill build files are written in Scala,
even if you are using it to build a Java project.

Once you have the language server installed, you can ask VSCode to open any folder
containing a Mill `build.mill` file, and VSCode will ask you to import your
Mill build. This will provide support both for your application code,
as well as the code in the `build.mill`:

image::basic/VSCodeApp.png[]

image::basic/VSCodeBuild.png[]

If you make changes to your Mill `build.sc`, you can ask VSCode to load
those updates by opening the "BSP" tab and clicking the "Refresh" button

image::basic/VSCodeRefresh.png[]

=== Debugging IDE issues

In case things go wrong, it can be sometimes hard to find the cause.
BSP is just a protocol, and as such, issues on the server side (the Mill BSP
server) might not well propagated to the BSP client (your IDE).

For that reason Mill BSP server is writing a log file under
`.bsp/mill-bsp.stderr`, where you can find various information about what's
going on. Its content should look familiar, as it contains regular Mill
output accompanied by additional BSP client-server communication details.

You can increase the verbosity of that log file, when you run Mill with
`--debug` at installation time (of the BSP discovery file).

[source,bash]
----
mill --debug mill.bsp.BSP/install
----

=== BSP Gotchas: Mismatching JVM versions

A common issue for poor performance can be a mismatch of the JVMs.
In such a case the Mill BSP server started by a BSP client like Metals is using a _different_ JVM than `mill` is using when started from the command line.
In such a scenario, every Mill invocation using the other JVM will inadvertently invalidate Mills task caches.
This effectively leads to full reevaluation of all invoked Mill tasks and appears as "bad performance".

To detect if this is the case,

1. import the project in the BSP client.
2. Wait until the BSP import process has finished.
3. Then run `mill __.compile` in the terminal.
4. Now watch the IDE, to see if the compile command invoked in the terminal has triggered compilation on the build server.

If this happens, you're using different JVMs.
Unfortunately, this is rather difficult to "defend" programmatically in Mill itself.
It is an explicit design goal of Mill, that it should work in different environments.
It is evident and likely unintentional that you have two conflicting local environments.

To fix this it's required to find where this difference stems from.
As a starting point,

* Find out which JVM is used for Mill on the CLi. `mill --version` reports its JVM.

* Search the `.bsp/mill-bsp.stderr` file for a line starting with `"Updating Evaluator"`.
It should contain all env variables (particularly `JAVA_HOME`) used by the BSP server.

Once you found and fixed that and the environments are the same, `clean` and restarting BSP should work as expected.

== Updating Mill

Typically, most Mill projects use a `.mill-version` file to configure what version
to use. You can update the version specified in this file in order to change the version
of Mill. The file path `.config/mill-version` is also supported. If neither is provided,
the `./mill` bootstrap script will use the `DEFAULT_MILL_VERSION` it has built in.

To choose a different Mill version on an ad-hoc basis, e.g. for experimentation, you can pass
in a `MILL_VERSION` environment variable, e.g.

[source,bash]
----
MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb mill __.compile
----

or

[source,bash]
----
MILL_VERSION=0.5.0-3-4faefb ./mill __.compile
----

to override the Mill version manually. This takes precedence over the version
specified in `./mill`, `.config/mill-version` or `.mill-version`


== Running Mill with custom JVM options

It's possible to pass JVM options to the Mill launcher. To do this you need to
create a `.mill-jvm-opts` file in your project's root. This file should contain
JVM options, one per line.

For example, if your build requires a lot of memory and bigger stack size, your
`.mill-jvm-opts` could look like this:

----
-Xss10m
-Xmx10G
----

The file name for passing JVM options to the Mill launcher is configurable. If
for some reason you don't want to use `.mill-jvm-opts` file name, add
`MILL_JVM_OPTS_PATH` environment variable with any other file name.

== Other installation methods

Of course, you can also use the package manager of your operating system or distribution.
Please keep in mind, that all those solutions listed below are maintained outside of Mill and may not have the same features as the <<_bootstrap_scripts,bootstrap scripts>>.

CAUTION: Some of the installations via package managers install a fixed version of Mill and do not support project-specific selection of the preferred Mill version. If you want to use the `MILL_VERSION` environment variable or need support for `.mill-version` or `.config/mill-version` files to control the actual used Mill version, please use a <<_bootstrap_scripts,Bootstrap script>> instead.
