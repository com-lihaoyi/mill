{mill-github-url}[Mill] is your shiny new Java/Scala build tool! Mill aims for
simplicity by reusing concepts you are already familiar with, borrowing ideas
from modern tools like https://maven.apache.org/[Maven], https://gradle.org/[Gradle],
https://bazel.build/[Bazel] and https://www.scala-sbt.org/[SBT]. It lets you build
your projects in a way that's simple, fast, and predictable.

Mill automates dealing with a lot of common build-tool concerns: Caching,
incremental re-computation, parallelism, discoverability, etc. This allows you
to focus your effort on the business logic unique to your build, while letting
Mill take care of all the rest.

Mill has built-in support for the Java and https://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala]
programming language, and can serve as a replacement for
https://maven.apache.org/[Maven], https://gradle.org/[Gradle], or
http://www.scala-sbt.org/[SBT]. It can be xref:Extending_Mill.adoc[extended]
to support any other language or platform via modules or through
external subprocesses. Mill supports a rich ecosystem of
xref:Contrib_Plugins.adoc[] and xref:Thirdparty_Plugins.adoc[].

If you are using Mill, you will find the following book by the Author useful in
using Mill and its supporting libraries to the fullest:

If you prefer a video introduction rather than text, the following presentation
(and companion blog post) is a good introduction into what the Mill build tool is
all about:

The rest of this page contains a quick introduction to getting start with using
Mill to build a simple program. The other pages of this doc-site go into
more depth, with more examples of how to use Mill and more details of how the
Mill build tool works.
