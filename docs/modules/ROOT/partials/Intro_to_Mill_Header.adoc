* **Mill builds are easy to extend by non-experts**: anyone can extend a Mill build
with a few lines of code, without needing to learn a complicated plugin framework,
allowing end users the freedom to fit their build logic to their own unique requirements

* **Mill builds are familiar to anyone who knows programming**: rather than scopes, lifecycles,
or phases, Mill builds on top of objects, methods, inheritance, and overrides: concepts
immediately familiar to any Java programmer

Mill can be xref:Extending_Mill.adoc[extended]
to support any other language or platform via modules or through
external subprocesses. Mill supports a rich ecosystem of
xref:Contrib_Plugins.adoc[] and xref:Thirdparty_Plugins.adoc[].

If you prefer a video introduction rather than text, the following presentation
(and companion blog post) is a good introduction into what the Mill build tool is
all about:

The rest of this page contains a quick introduction to getting start with using
Mill to build a simple program. The other pages of this doc-site go into
more depth, with more examples of how to use Mill and more details of how the
Mill build tool works.
