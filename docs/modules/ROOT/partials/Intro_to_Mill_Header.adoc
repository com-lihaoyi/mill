{mill-github-url}[Mill] is a fast multi-language build tool that supports {language}, speeding
up common development workflows by 2-10x xref:Case_Study_Mill_vs_Maven.adoc[compared to Maven],
xref:Case_Study_Mill_vs_Gradle.adoc[Gradle], or SBT.
Mill aims to make your JVM project's build process performant, maintainable, and flexible
even as it grows from a small project to a large codebase or monorepo with hundreds of modules:

* *Performance*: Mill's xref:Tasks.adoc[build graph] automatically
  xref:The_Mill_Evaluation_Model.adoc#_caching_at_each_layer_of_the_evaluation_model[caches]
  and xref:#_parallel_task_execution[parallelizes] build
  tasks, minimizing the amount of work that needs to be done and keeping your workflows
  fast and responsive. Mill adds minimal overhead over the logic necessary to build your
  project, while providing tools to let you identify and resolve bottlenecks in your build

* *Maintainability*: Mill config and custom logic is written in
  xref:_custom_build_logic[custom build logic] in concise type-checked code,
  rather than shell scripts, XML or YAML. This also allows Mill's IDE support
  (via xref:{language}_Installation_IDE_Support.adoc#_intellij[IntelliJ] or
  xref:{language}_Installation_IDE_Support.adoc#_vscode[VSCode])
  to let you "*jump-to-definition*" around your build
  as easily as any application codebase.

* *Flexibility*: Mill's custom tasks and modules allow anything from
  xref:Tasks.adoc#primitive-tasks[adding simple pipelines], up to
  xref:Modules.adoc#_use_case_diy_java_modules[adding entire language toolchains],
  meaning it can be easily customized to fit exactly what you need. This means you
  are never beholden to third-party plugins which may not work well together,
  be maintained, or exist at all.
