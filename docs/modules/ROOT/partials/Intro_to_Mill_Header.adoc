{mill-github-url}[Mill] is a fast multi-language JVM build tool that supports {language}, making your
common development workflows xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[5-10x faster to Maven], or
xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc[2-4x faster than Gradle], while providing better IDE support
than xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_extensibility_ide_experience[Maven],
xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc#_ide_experience[Gradle] or xref:comparisons/sbt.adoc#_ide_support[SBT].
Mill aims to make your JVM project's build process performant, maintainable, and flexible
even as it grows from a small project to a large codebase or monorepo with hundreds of modules:

* *Performance*: Mill's xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc[build graph] automatically
  xref:depth/evaluation-model.adoc#_caching_at_each_layer_of_the_evaluation_model[caches]
  and xref:#_parallel_task_execution[parallelizes] build
  tasks, keeping your workflows fast and responsive. Mill adds minimal overhead over
  the logic necessary to build your project, while providing tools to let you identify
  and resolve bottlenecks in your build

* *Maintainability*: Mill goes beyond YAML and Bash, with config and custom logic written in
  xref:_custom_build_logic[concise type-checked code],
  rather than shell scripts, XML or YAML. This lets IDEs
  (xref:{language-small}lib/installation-ide.adoc#_intellij[IntelliJ] or
  xref:{language-small}lib/installation-ide.adoc#_vscode[VSCode])
  understand and navigate around and refactor your build as easily as
  any application codebase.

* *Flexibility*: Mill's custom tasks and modules allow anything from adding 
  xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc#primitive-tasks[simple build steps], up to
  entire xref:extending/new-language.adoc[language toolchains].
  You can xref:extending/import-ivy-plugins.adoc[import any JVM library] as part of your build,
  use Mill's rich ecosystem of xref:extending/thirdparty-plugins.adoc[Third-Party Mill Plugins],
  or xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc[write plugins] yourself and
  xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc#_publishing[publish them] to Maven Central for others to use.
