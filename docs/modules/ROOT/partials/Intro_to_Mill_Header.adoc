{mill-github-url}[Mill] is a JVM build tool that supports {language}. Mill aims to make
your JVM project's build process performant, maintainable, and flexible:

* *Performance*: Mill's xref:Tasks.adoc[build graph] automatically
  xref:The_Mill_Evaluation_Model.adoc#_caching_at_each_layer_of_the_evaluation_model[caches]
  and xref:#_parallel_task_execution[parallelizes] build
  steps (called "*targets*"), minimizing the amount of work that needs to be done, and
  automatically profiling your build so you can optimize it. Even for large codebases with
  hundreds of modules, Mill keeps your workflows fast and responsive.

* *Maintainability*: Mill build targets are self contained without side-effects, making it easy
  to trace the data-flow of your build. Mill also provides excellent IDE support
  (via xref:{language}_Installation_IDE_Support.adoc#_intellij[IntelliJ] or
  xref:{language}_Installation_IDE_Support.adoc#_vscode[VSCode]),
  letting you use "*jump-to-definition*" to navigate around your build
  as easily as any application codebase. This makes maintaining Mill builds
  a far easier than the "*guess and grep*" workflows common with other build tools.

* *Flexibility*: Mill lets you write your xref:_custom_build_logic[custom build logic]
  in type-checked code, rather than
  error-prone shell scripts, verbose AntRun XML, or complicated external plugins. Mill's
  custom targets and modules allow anything from
  xref:Tasks.adoc#primitive-tasks[adding simple pipelines], up to
  xref:Modules.adoc#_use_case_diy_java_modules[adding entire language toolchains].
  This means Mill does not limit you to what Mill knows how to do, and can be easily
  customized to fit what *you* need to get done.

These properties mean that Mill is able to scale well from small projects to
large codebases with hundreds of modules: its performance keeps things snappy,
its maintainability keeps things tidy, and its flexibility supports
the ad-hoc customizations that inevitably appear as projects grow.
