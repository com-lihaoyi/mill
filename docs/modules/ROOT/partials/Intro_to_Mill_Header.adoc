{mill-github-url}[Mill] is a fast multi-language build tool that supports {language}, making your
common development workflows xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[5-10x faster to Maven], or
xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc[2-4x faster than Gradle], with
xref:comparisons/sbt[an easier experience than SBT].
Mill aims to make your JVM project's build process performant, maintainable, and flexible
even as it grows from a small project to a large codebase or monorepo with hundreds of modules:

* *Performance*: Mill's xref:depth/tasks.adoc[build graph] automatically
  xref:depth/evaluation-model.adoc#_caching_at_each_layer_of_the_evaluation_model[caches]
  and xref:#_parallel_task_execution[parallelizes] build
  tasks, keeping your workflows fast and responsive. Mill adds minimal overhead over
  the logic necessary to build your project, while providing tools to let you identify
  and resolve bottlenecks in your build

* *Maintainability*: Mill config and custom logic is written in
  xref:_custom_build_logic[custom build logic] in concise type-checked code,
  rather than shell scripts, XML or YAML. This lets IDEs
  (xref:{language-small}lib/installation-ide.adoc#_intellij[IntelliJ] or
  xref:{language-small}lib/installation-ide.adoc#_vscode[VSCode])
  "jump-to-definition" to navigate around your build as easily as any application codebase.

* *Flexibility*: Mill's custom tasks and modules allow anything from
  xref:depth/tasks.adoc#primitive-tasks[adding simple pipelines], up to
  xref:depth/modules.adoc#_use_case_diy_java_modules[entire language toolchains].
  This means Mill can be easily customized to fit exactly what you need without being beholden
  to third-party plugins which may not work well together or be well maintained.
