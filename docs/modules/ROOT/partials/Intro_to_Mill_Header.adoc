Mill is a fast, scalable, multi-language JVM build tool that supports
Java, Scala, and Kotlin:

* Mill builds can compile the same codebase xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[5-10x faster than Maven],
  or xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc[2-4x faster than Gradle]

* Mill's typed, functional config language provides a richer IDE experience
  than xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_extensibility_ide_experience[Maven],
  xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc#_ide_experience[Gradle] or xref:comparisons/sbt.adoc#_ide_support[SBT].

* Mill scales well from small single-module projects
  to xref:depth/large-builds.adoc[large monorepos] with hundreds of modules

Mill achieves this via the following:

* *Performance*: Mill's xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc[build graph] automatically
  xref:depth/evaluation-model.adoc#_caching_at_each_layer_of_the_evaluation_model[caches]
  and xref:#_parallel_task_execution[parallelizes] build
  tasks, keeping your workflows fast and responsive. Mill adds minimal overhead over
  the logic necessary to build your project, while providing tools to let you identify
  and resolve bottlenecks in your build

* *Maintainability*: Mill goes beyond YAML and Bash, with config and custom logic written in
  xref:_custom_build_logic[concise type-checked code]. This catches bugs and
  config problems at compile time, and lets IDEs
  (xref:{language-small}lib/installation-ide.adoc#_intellij[IntelliJ] or
  xref:{language-small}lib/installation-ide.adoc#_vscode[VSCode])
  understand and navigate around your build as easily as
  any application codebase.

* *Flexibility*: Mill's tasks and modules allow anything from adding
  xref:fundamentals/tasks.adoc#primitive-tasks[simple build steps], up to
  entire xref:extending/new-language.adoc[language toolchains].
  You can xref:extending/import-ivy-plugins.adoc[import any JVM library] in your build,
  use Mill's rich ecosystem of xref:extending/thirdparty-plugins.adoc[Third-Party Mill Plugins],
  or xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc[write plugins] yourself and
  xref:extending/writing-plugins.adoc#_publishing[publish them] to Maven Central for others to use.
