{mill-github-url}[Mill] is a fast JVM build tool that supports {language}, speeding
up common development workflows by 2-10x xref:Case_Study_Mill_vs_Maven.adoc[compared to Maven],
xref:Case_Study_Mill_vs_Gradle.adoc[Gradle], or SBT.
Mill aims to make your JVM project's build process performant, maintainable, and flexible
even as it grows from a small project to a large codebase or monorepo with hundreds of modules:

* *Performance*: Mill's xref:Tasks.adoc[build graph] automatically
  xref:The_Mill_Evaluation_Model.adoc#_caching_at_each_layer_of_the_evaluation_model[caches]
  and xref:#_parallel_task_execution[parallelizes] build
  tasks, minimizing the amount of work that needs to be done and keeping your workflows
  fast and responsive.

* *Maintainability*: Mill build tasks are without side-effects making it easy
  to trace the data-flow, and its IDE support
  (via xref:{language}_Installation_IDE_Support.adoc#_intellij[IntelliJ] or
  xref:{language}_Installation_IDE_Support.adoc#_vscode[VSCode])
  lets you "*jump-to-definition*" around your build
  as easily as any application codebase. Mill custom logic is written in
  xref:_custom_build_logic[custom build logic] in concise type-checked code, rather than
  error-prone shell scripts, verbose AntRun XML, or complicated external plugins.

* *Flexibility*: Mill's custom tasks and modules allow anything from
  xref:Tasks.adoc#primitive-tasks[adding simple pipelines], up to
  xref:Modules.adoc#_use_case_diy_java_modules[adding entire language toolchains],
  meaning it can be easily customized to fit exactly what you need. This means you
  are never beholden to third-party plugins which may not work well together or,
  be maintained, or exist at all.
