Mill borrows ideas from other tools like https://maven.apache.org/[Maven],
https://gradle.org/[Gradle], https://bazel.build/[Bazel], but tries to learn from the
strengths of each tool and improve on their weaknesses. Although Maven and Gradle
are mature widely-used tools, they have fundamental limitations in their design
(https://blog.ltgt.net/maven-is-broken-by-design/[Maven],
https://www.bruceeckel.com/2021/01/02/the-problem-with-gradle/[Gradle]) that make
them difficult to improve upon incrementally.

xref:comparisons/maven.adoc[Compared to Maven]:

* **Mill follows Maven's innovation of good built-in defaults**: Mill's built-in
  ``JavaModule``s follow Maven's "convention over configuration" style, so small Mill
  projects require minimal effort to get started, and larger Mill projects have a consistent
  structure building on these defaults.

* **Mill automatically caches and parallelizes your build, offering 3-10x speedups**:
  Not just the built-in tasks that Mill ships with, but also any custom tasks or modules.
  This maximizes the snappiness of your command-line build workflows to keep you productive,
  which especially matters in larger codebases where builds tend to get slow:
  xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_performance[a Maven "clean install" workflow
  taking over a minute might take just a few seconds in Mill].

* **Mill makes customizing the build tool much easier than Maven**. Projects usually
  grow beyond just compiling a single language: needing custom
  code generation, linting workflows, tool integrations, output artifacts, or support for
  additional languages. Mill's xref:comparisons/maven.adoc#_extensibility_ide_experience[extensibility and IDE experience]
  makes doing this yourself easy and safe, with type-checked code and
  xref:depth/sandboxing.adoc[sandboxed tasks]


xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc[Compared to Gradle]:

* **Mill follows Gradle's conciseness and extensibility**: Rather than pages and pages of verbose XML, every
  line in a Mill build is meaningful. e.g. adding a dependency is 1 line in
  Mill, like it is in Gradle, and unlike the 5 line `<dependency>` declaration you find in Maven.
  Like Gradle, end users can easily customize their build to fit their exact needs without
  needing to go through the process of writing plugins.

* **Mill can be xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc#_performance[2-3x faster than Gradle]**:
  Although both Mill and Gradle automatically cache and parallelize your build, Mill
  does so with much less fixed overhead. This means less time waiting for your build
  tool, and more time for the things that really matter to your project.

* **Mill enforces best practices by default**.
  xref:depth/evaluation-model.adoc#_caching_at_each_layer_of_the_evaluation_model[All parts of a Mill build are cached and incremental by default].
  All Mill tasks write their output to xref:fundamentals/out-dir.adoc[a standard place].
  All task inter-dependencies are automatically captured without manual annotation. Where Gradle requires
  considerable effort and expertise to understand your build and set it up in the right way, Mill's
  xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc#_ide_experience[good IDE experience] makes understanding
  your build easier, and its xref:comparisons/gradle.adoc#_extensibility[extensibility model]
  makes configuring your build foolproof, so the easiest thing to do in Mill is usually the
  right thing to do.

Mill build files are written in Scala, but you do not need to have prior experience
in Scala to read or write them. Like Gradle Groovy or Maven XML, anyone can learn
enough Scala for Mill without needing to become an expert in the language.
