== Watch and Re-evaluate

You can use the `--watch` flag to make Mill watch a task's inputs,
re-evaluating the task as necessary when the inputs
change:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill --watch foo.compile
$ mill --watch foo.run
$ mill -w foo.compile
$ mill -w foo.run
----

Mill's `--watch` flag watches both the files you are building using Mill, as
well as Mill's own `build.mill` file and anything it imports, so any changes to
your `build.mill` will automatically get picked up.

For long-running processes like web servers, you can use `runBackground` to make sure they recompile and restart when code changes,
forcefully terminating the previous process even though it may be still alive:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill -w foo.runBackground
----


== Parallel Task Execution

By default, Mill will evaluate all tasks in parallel, with the number of concurrent
tasks equal to the number of cores on your machine. You can use the `--jobs` (`-j`) to configure
explicitly how many concurrent tasks you wish to run. To disable parallel execution use `-j1`.

Example: Use up to 4 parallel threads to compile all modules:

[source,bash]
----
mill -j4 __.compile
----



Every `mill` run generates an output file in `out/mill-chrome-profile.json` that can be
loaded into the Chrome browser's `chrome://tracing` page for visualization.
This can make it much easier to analyze your parallel runs to find out what's
taking the most time:

Note that the maximal possible parallelism depends both on the number of cores
available as well as the task and module structure of your project, as tasks that
depend on one another other cannot be processed in parallel

== Mill Cheat Sheet

Mill is a command-line tool and supports various options. Run `mill --help` for
a complete list of options and a cheat-sheet of how to work with tasks:

Mill Build Tool, version {mill-version}
Usage: mill [options] task [task-options] [+ task ...]

task cheat sheet:
  mill resolve _                 # see all top-level tasks and modules
  mill resolve __.compile        # see all `compile` tasks in any module (recursively)

  mill foo.bar.compile           # compile the module `foo.bar`

  mill foo.run --arg 1           # run the main method of the module `foo` and pass in `--arg 1`
  mill -i foo.console            # run the Scala console for the module `foo` (if it is a ScalaModule)

  mill foo.__.test               # run tests in modules nested within `foo` (recursively)
  mill foo.test arg1 arg2        # run tests in the `foo` module passing in test arguments `arg1 arg2`
  mill foo.test + bar.test       # run tests in the `foo` module and `bar` module
  mill '{foo,bar,qux}.test'      # run tests in the `foo` module, `bar` module, and `qux` module

  mill foo.assembly              # generate an executable assembly of the module `foo`
  mill show foo.assembly         # print the output path of the assembly of module `foo`
  mill inspect foo.assembly      # show docs and metadata for the `assembly` task on module `foo`

  mill clean foo.assembly        # delete the output of `foo.assembly` to force re-evaluation
  mill clean                     # delete the output of the entire build to force re-evaluation

  mill path foo.run foo.sources  # print the task chain showing how `foo.run` depends on `foo.sources`
  mill visualize __.compile      # show how the `compile` tasks in each module depend on one another

options:
  -D --define <k=v>    Define (or overwrite) a system property.
  --allow-positional   Allows command args to be passed positionally without `--arg` by default
  -b --bell            Ring the bell once if the run completes successfully, twice if it fails.
  --bsp                Enable BSP server mode.
  --color <bool>       Toggle colored output; by default enabled only if the console is interactive
  -d --debug           Show debug output on STDOUT
  --disable-callgraph  Disables fine-grained invalidation of tasks based on analyzing code changes.
                       If passed, you need to manually run `clean` yourself after build changes.
  --help               Print this help message and exit.
  -i --interactive     Run Mill in interactive mode, suitable for opening REPLs and taking user
                       input. This implies --no-server. Must be the first argument.
  --import <str>       Additional ivy dependencies to load into mill, e.g. plugins.
  -j --jobs <str>      The number of parallel threads. It can be an integer e.g. `5` meaning 5
                       threads, an expression e.g. `0.5C` meaning half as many threads as available
                       cores, or `C-2` meaning 2 threads less than the number of cores. `1` disables
                       parallelism and `0` (the default) uses 1 thread per core.
  -k --keep-going      Continue build, even after build failures.
  --meta-level <int>   Select a meta-level to run the given tasks. Level 0 is the main project in
                       `build.mill`, level 1 the first meta-build in `mill-build/build.mill`, etc.
  --no-server          Run without a background server. Must be the first argument.
  -s --silent          Make ivy logs during script import resolution go silent instead of printing
  --ticker <bool>      Enable ticker log (e.g. short-lived prints of stages and progress bars).
  -v --version         Show mill version information and exit.
  -w --watch           Watch and re-run the given tasks when when their inputs change.
  task <str>...        The name or a pattern of the tasks(s) you want to build.

Please see the documentation at https://mill-build.org for more details

Note that options and flags given before the `task` name are _passed to Mill_, while
options and flags after the `task` name are _passed to the task_. This mirrors how
most command line script or task runners work (e.g. `python <python-args> script.py <script-args>`)
