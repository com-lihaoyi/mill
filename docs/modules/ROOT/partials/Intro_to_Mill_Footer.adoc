== Watch and Re-evaluate

You can use the `--watch` flag to make Mill watch a task's inputs,
re-evaluating the task as necessary when the inputs
change:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill --watch foo.compile
$ mill --watch foo.run
$ mill -w foo.compile
$ mill -w foo.run
----

Mill's `--watch` flag watches both the files you are building using Mill, as
well as Mill's own `build.mill` file and anything it imports, so any changes to
your `build.mill` will automatically get picked up.

For long-running processes like web servers, you can use `runBackground` to make sure they recompile and restart when code changes,
forcefully terminating the previous process even though it may be still alive:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill -w foo.runBackground
----


== Parallel Task Execution

By default, Mill will evaluate all tasks in parallel, with the number of concurrent
tasks equal to the number of cores on your machine. You can use the `--jobs` (`-j`) to configure
explicitly how many concurrent tasks you wish to run. To disable parallel execution use `-j1`.

Example: Use up to 4 parallel threads to compile all modules:

[source,bash]
----
mill -j4 __.compile
----



Every `mill` run generates an output file in `out/mill-chrome-profile.json` that can be
loaded into the Chrome browser's `chrome://tracing` page for visualization.
This can make it much easier to analyze your parallel runs to find out what's
taking the most time:

Note that the maximal possible parallelism depends both on the number of cores
available as well as the task and module structure of your project, as tasks that
depend on one another other cannot be processed in parallel
