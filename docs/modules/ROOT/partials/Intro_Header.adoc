This page contains a quick introduction to getting start with using Mill to build
a simple {language} program. We will walk through a series of Mill builds of increasing
complexity to show you the key features and usage of the Mill build tool.

The other pages of this section on {language} go into more depth into individual features,
with more examples of how to use Mill for {language} and more details of how the Mill
build tool works. They aren't intended to be read comprehensively top-to-bottom, but
rather looked up when you have a particular interest e.g. in testing, linting,
publishing, and so on.
