= Version file

This plugin provides helpers for updating a version file and committing the changes to git.

*Note: You can still make manual changes to the version file in-between execution of the targets provided by the module.*
*Each target operates on the version file as is at the time of execution.*

== Quickstart

Add a `VersionFileModule` to the `build.sc` file:

[source,scala]
----
import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-versionfile:`
import mill.contrib.versionfile.VersionFileModule

object versionFile extends VersionFileModule
----

The module will read and write to the file `version` located at the module's `millSourcePath`.
In the example above, that would be `/versionFile/version` relative to the `build.sc` file.

Create the version file with the initial version number:

[source,bash]
----
$ 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT > versionFile/version
----

Then to write a release version or snapshot version to file:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill versionFile.setReleaseVersion           # Sets release
$ mill versionFile.setNextVersion --bump minor # Sets snapshot
----

You can also make manual changes in-between:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill versionFile.setReleaseVersion
$ echo 0.1.0 > versionFile/version
$ mill versionFile.setNextVersion --bump minor # Will now set the version to 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT
----

If you want to use the version file for publishing, you can do it like this:

[source,scala]
----
import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-versionfile:`
import mill.contrib.versionfile.VersionFileModule

object versionFile extends VersionFileModule

object mymodule extends PublishModule {
  def publishVersion = versionFile.currentVersion().toString
  ...
}
----

== Configure the version file

If you want the version file to have another name, you will need to override the `versionFile` task.

If you have a project wide version file like in the example above, and you want the version file to reside
at the root of the project, you can override `millSourcePath`:

[source,scala]
----
import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-versionfile:`
import mill.contrib.versionfile.VersionFileModule

object versionFile extends VersionFileModule {
  def millSourcePath = millOuterCtx.millSourcePath
}
----

In this example, it would look for the file `version` in the same directory as the `build.sc`.

== Set release version

The `setReleaseVersion` target removes the `-SNAPSHOT` identifier from the version,
then overwrites the previous content in the version file with this new version.

=== Example

Your version file contains `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`. In your terminal you do the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill versionFile.setReleaseVersion
----

This will update the version file to contain `0.1.0`.

== Set next version

The `setNextVersion` target bumps the version and changes it to a snapshot version,
then overwrites the previous content in the version file with this new version.

=== Parameters

==== –bump (major | minor | patch)

Sets what segment of the version to bump.

For a version number `1.2.3` in the version file:

`--bump major` will set it to `2.0.0`

`--bump minor` will set it to `1.3.0`

`--bump patch` will set it to `1.2.4`

=== Example

Your version file contains `0.1.0`. In your terminal you do the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill versionFile.setNextVersion --bump minor
----

This will update the version file to contain `0.2.0-SNAPSHOT`.

== Set version

The `setVersion` overwrites the previous content of the version file with an arbitrary version.

=== Parameters

==== –version x.y.z[-SNAPSHOT]

The version to write to the version file.

=== Example

Your version file contains `0.1.0`. In your terminal you do the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill versionFile.setVersion --version 0.5.2-SNAPSHOT
----

This will update the version file to contain `0.5.2-SNAPSHOT`.

== Output version numbers

If you need to output the version numbers (for example for other CI tools you might use), you can use the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
# Show the current version from the version file.
$ mill show versionFile.currentVersion
----

[source,bash]
----
# Show the version that would be used as release version.
$ mill show versionFile.releaseVersion
----

[source,bash]
----
# Show the version that would be used as next version with the given --bump argument.
$ mill show versionFile.nextVersion --bump minor
----

== VCS operations

The module has an `exec` task that allows you to execute tasks of type `T[Seq[os.proc]]`:

[source,bash]
----
$ mill mill.contrib.versionfile.VersionFile/exec --procs versionFile.tag
$ mill mill.contrib.versionfile.VersionFile/exec --procs versionFile.push
----

=== Built-in git operations

The `VersionFileModule` comes with two tasks of this type:

==== Tag

Commits the changes, then creates a tag with the current version for that commit.

==== Push

Commits the changes, then pushes the changes to origin/master with tags.

=== Custom operations

It's possible to override the tasks above, or add your own tasks, to adapt the module
to work with other version control systems than git.
