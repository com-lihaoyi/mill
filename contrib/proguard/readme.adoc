= Proguard

This module allows https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard/manual/introduction[Proguard] to be used in Mill builds.
ProGuard is a Java class file shrinker, optimizer, obfuscator, and preverifier.

By default, all four steps - shrink, optimize, obfuscate, verify - are run, but this can be configured through task options.
Any additional options can be specified as a list of strings with `additionalOptions`. The full list of proguard options
can be found https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard/manual/usage[here].

The output of `assembly` is used as the input jar and the output is written to `out.jar` in the `dest` folder.

The `stdout` and `stderr` from the proguard command can be found under the `dest` folder.

The only default entrypoint is the main class (i.e. `finalMainClass` task). Additional entrypoints can be configured using `additionalOptions` as well.

Here is a simple example:

.`build.sc`
[source,scala]
----
import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-proguard:`
import contrib.proguard._

object foo extends ScalaModule with Proguard {
  def scalaVersion = "2.13.8"

  override def shrink: T[Boolean] = T { true }
  override def optimize: T[Boolean] = T { false }
  override def obfuscate: T[Boolean] = T { false }
}
