= Proguard
:page-aliases: Plugin_Proguard.adoc

This module allows https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard/manual/introduction[Proguard] to be used in Mill builds.
ProGuard is a Java class file shrinker, optimizer, obfuscator, and preverifier.

By default, all four steps - shrink, optimize, obfuscate, verify - are run, but this can be configured through task options.
Any additional options can be specified as a list of strings with `additionalOptions`. The full list of proguard options
can be found https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard/manual/usage[here].

The output of `assembly` is used as the input jar and the output is written to `out.jar` in the `dest` folder.

The `stdout` and `stderr` from the proguard command can be found under the `dest` folder.

The only default entrypoint is the main class (i.e. `finalMainClass` task). Additional entrypoints can be configured using `additionalOptions` as well.

Here is a simple example:

.`build.mill`
[source,scala]
----
package build
import $ivy.`com.lihaoyi::mill-contrib-proguard:`
import contrib.proguard._

object foo extends ScalaModule with Proguard {
  def scalaVersion = "2.13.8"

  override def shrink: T[Boolean] = Task { true }
  override def optimize: T[Boolean] = Task { false }
  override def obfuscate: T[Boolean] = Task { false }

  // https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard/releases
  override def proguardVersion = T("7.3.2")

  // tell Proguard where to enter your app, so it can optimise outwards from there
  override def entryPoint = Task {
    s"""|-keep public class myProject.main.myApp {
        |  public ReturnType main(ParamTypeA, ParamTypeB);
        |}
        |""".stripMargin
  }

  // customise to be as narrow/wide as your application requires
  override def additionalOptions = Seq (
    "-keep class myProject.main.myApp { *; }",
    "-keep class Scala.Symbol { *; };
  )
}
