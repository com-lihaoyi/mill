name: Publish Artifacts

# Tags are automatically published
#
# Manual publishing (workflow_dispatch) from the main branch is also supported
#
# Separate from main test running, because we assume that anything you push a
# tag for or trigger manually would already have passed tests, so no need to run
# them again and deal with slowness and flakiness twice.
