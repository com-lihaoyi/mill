name: Publish Bridges

# We run full CI on push builds to main and on all pull requests
#
# Tags are automatically published
#
# Manual builds (workflow_dispatch) to the main branch are also published
#
# To maximize bug-catching changes while keeping CI times reasonable, we run:
# - All tests on Linux/Java17
# - Fewer tests on Linux/Java8 and Windows/Java17
# - Fewest tests on Windows/Java8

    # only run one publish job for the same sha at the same time
