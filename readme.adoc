Your shiny new Scala build tool! Confused by SBT? Frustrated by Maven? Perplexed by Gradle?
Give Mill a try!

== Documentation

If you want to use Mill in your own projects, check out our documentation:

* {link-current-doc-site}[Documentation]

Here is some quick example, so that you can imagine how it looks:

[source,scala,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
import mill._, scalalib._

object foo extends ScalaModule {
  def scalaVersion = "{example-scala-version}"
}

object bar extends ScalaModule {
  def moduleDeps = Seq(foo)
  def scalaVersion = "{example-scala-version}"
}

----

If you use Mill and like it, you will probably enjoy the following book by the Author:

* https://www.handsonscala.com/[_Hands-on Scala Programming_]

The remainder of this readme is developer-documentation targeted at people who
wish to work on Mill's own codebase. The developer docs assume you have read
through the user-facing documentation linked above. It's also worth spending a
few minutes reading the following blog posts to get a sense of Mill's design &
motivation:

* http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/SowhatswrongwithSBT.html["So, what's wrong with SBT?"]
* http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildToolsasPureFunctionalPrograms.html[Build Tools as Pure Functional Programs]
* http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/MillBetterScalaBuilds.html[Mill: Better Scala Builds]

Mill is profiled using the 
https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html[JProfiler Java Profiler], 
by courtesy of EJ Technologies.

Mill is built using Mill. To begin, you just need a JVM installed, and the
`./mill` script will be sufficient to bootstrap the project.



== IntelliJ Setup

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA to edit Mill's Scala code, you can create the
IntelliJ project files via:

[source,bash]
----
./mill mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea
----

== Manual & Automated Testing

The following table contains the main ways you can test the code in
`com-lihaoyi/mill`, via manual testing or automated tests:

|===
| Config | Automated Testing | Manual Testing | Manual Testing CI
| In-Process Tests | `main.__.test`, `scalalib.test`, `contrib.buildinfo.test`, etc. |  |
| Sub-Process w/o packaging/publishing| `example.\\__.local`, `integration.__.local` | `dev.run` | `test-mill-dev.sh`
| Sub-Process w/ packaging/publishing | `example.\\__.server`, `integration.__.server` | `dev.assembly` | `test-mill-release.sh`
| Bootstrapping: Building Mill with your current checkout of Mill |  | `installLocal` | `test-mill-bootstrap.sh`
|===

=== In-Process Tests

In-process tests live in the `.test` sub-modules of the various Mill modules.
These range from tiny unit tests, to larger integration tests that instantiate
a `TestUtil.BaseModule` in-process and a `TestEvaluator` to evaluate tasks on
it.

Most "core" tests live in `main.__test`; these should run almost instantly, and
cover most of Mill's functionality that is not specific to Scala/Scala.js/etc..
Tests specific to Scala/Scala.js/Scala-Native live in
`scalalib.test`/`scalajslib.test`/`scalanativelib.test` respectively, and take
a lot longer to run because running them involves actually compiling Scala code.

The various `contrib` modules also have tests in this style, e.g.
`contrib.buildinfo.test`

Note that the in-memory tests compile the `BaseModule` together with the test
suite, and do not exercise the Mill script-file bootstrapping, transformation,
and compilation process.

=== Sub-Process Tests *without* Packaging/Publishing

`example.\\__.local` and `integration.__.local` tests run Mill end-to-end in
a subprocess, but *without* the expensive/slow steps of packaging the core
packages into an assembly jar and publishing the remaining packages to
`~/.ivy2/local`. You can reproduce these tests manually using
`./mill dev.run <test-folder-path> <command>`.

`example` tests are written in a single `build.sc` file, with the test
commands written in a comment with a bash-like syntax together with the build
code and comments that explain the example. These serve three purposes:

1. Basic smoke-tests to make sure the functionality works at all, without
   covering every edge case

2. User-facing documentation, with the test cases, test commands, and
   explanatory comments included in the Mill documentation site

3. Example repositories, that Mill users can download to bootstrap their own
   projects

The `integration` tests are similar to `example` tests and share most of their
test infrastructure, but with differences:

1. `integration` tests are meant to test features more thoroughly then
   `example` tests, covering more and deeper edge cases even at the expense
   of readability

2. `integration` tests are written using a Scala test suite extending
   `IntegrationTestSuite`, giving more flexibility at the expense of readability

You can reproduce any of the tests manually using `dev.run`, e.g.

**Automated Test**

[source,bash]
----
./mill "example.basic[1-simple-scala].local"
----

**Manual Test**

[source,bash]
----
./mill dev.run example/basic/1-simple-scala run --text hello
----

**Manual Test using Launcher Script**

[source,bash]
----
./mill dev.launcher && (cd example/basic/1-simple-scala && ../../../out/dev/launcher.dest/run run --text hello)
----

=== Sub-Process Tests *with* Packaging/Publishing

`example.\\__.server`, `integration.__.server`, `example.\\__.fork` and
`integration.__.fork` cover the same test cases as the `.local` tests described
above, but they perform packaging of the Mill core modules into an assembly
jar, and publish the remaining modules to `~/.ivy2/local`. This results in a
more realistic test environment, but at the cost of taking tens-of-seconds more
to run a test after making a code change.

You can reproduce these tests manually using `dev.assembly`:

[source,bash]
----
./mill dev.assembly && (cd example/basic/1-simple-scala && ../../../out/dev/assembly.dest/mill run --text hello)
----

There are two flavors of these tests:

1. `.server` test run the test cases with the default configuration, so
   consecutive commands run in the same long-lived background server process

2. `.fork` test run the test cases with `--no-server`, meaning each command
   runs in a newly spawned Mill process

In general you should spend most of your time working with the `.local` version
of the `example` and `integration` tests to save time, and only run `.fork`
or `.server` once `.local` is passing.

=== Bootstrapping: Building Mill with your current checkout of Mill

To test bootstrapping of Mill's own Mill build using a version of Mill built
from your checkout, you can run

[source,bash]
----
./mill installLocal
ci/patch-mill-bootstrap.sh
----

This creates a standalone assembly at `target/mill-release` you can use, which
references jars published locally in your `~/.ivy2/local` cache, and applies
any necessary patches to `build.sc` to deal with changes in Mill between the
version specified in `.config/mill-version` that is normally used to build Mill
and the `HEAD` version your assembly was created from. You can then
use this standalone assembly to build & re-build your current Mill checkout
without worrying about stomping over compiled code that the assembly is using.

This assembly is design to work on bash, bash-like shells and Windows Cmd.
If you have another default shell like zsh or fish, you probably need to invoke it
with `sh ~/mill-release` or prepend the file with a proper shebang. 

If you want to install into a different location or a different Ivy repository, you can
set it's optional parameters

.Install into `/tmp`
[source,bash]
----
$ ./mill installLocal --binFile /tmp/mill --ivyRepo /tmp/millRepo
...
Published 44 modules and installed /tmp/mill
----

=== Troubleshooting

In case of troubles with caching and/or incremental compilation, you can always
restart from scratch removing the `out` directory:

[source,bash]
----
os.remove.all -rf out/
----

== Project Layout

The Mill project is organized roughly as follows:

=== Core modules that are included in the main assembly

* `runner`, `main.*`, `scalalib`, `scalajslib`, `scalanativelib`.

These are general lightweight and dependency-free: mostly configuration & wiring
of a Mill build and without the heavy lifting.

Heavy lifting is delegated to the worker modules (described below), which the
core modules resolve from Maven Central (or from the local filesystem in
dev) and load into isolated classloaders.

=== Worker modules that are resolved from Maven Central

* `scalalib.worker`, `scalajslib.worker[0.6]`, `scalajslib.worker[1.0]`

These modules are where the heavy-lifting happens, and include heavy
dependencies like the Scala compiler, Scala.js optimizer, etc.. Rather than
being bundled in the main assembly & classpath, these are resolved separately
from Maven Central (or from the local filesystem in dev) and kept in isolated
classloaders.

This allows a single Mill build to use multiple versions of e.g. the Scala.js
optimizer without classpath conflicts.

=== Contrib modules

* `contrib/bloop/`, `contrib/flyway/`, `contrib/scoverage/`, etc.

These are modules that help integrate Mill with the wide variety of different
tools and utilities available in the JVM ecosystem.

These modules are not as stringently reviewed as the main Mill core/worker codebase, and are primarily maintained by their individual contributors.
These are maintained as part of the primary Mill Github repo for easy testing/updating as the core Mill
APIs evolve, ensuring that they are always tested and passing against the
corresponding version of Mill.

== Compatibility & Stability

Mill maintains backward binary compatibility for each major version
(`major.minor.point`), enforced with Mima, for the following packages:

- `mill.api`
- `mill.util`
- `mill.define`
- `mill.eval`
- `mill.resolve`
- `mill.scalalib`
- `mill.scalajslib`
- `mill.scalanativelib`

Other package slike `mill.runner`, `mill.bsp`, etc. are on the classpath but
offer no compatibility guarantees.

Currently, Mill does not offer compatibility guarantees for `mill.contrib`
packages, although they tend to evolve slowly. This may change over time as
these packages mature over time.


== Project Maintenance

=== Pull Requests

* Changes to the main branch need a pull request. Exceptions are preparation commits for releases, which are meant to be pushed with tags in one go
* Merged pull request (and closed issues) need to be assigned to a Milestone
* Pull requests are typically merged via "Squash and merge", so we get a linear and useful history
* Larger pull request, where it makes sense to keep single commits, or with multiple authors may be committed via merge commits.

=== Commit Messages

* The title should be meaningful and may contain the pull request number in parentheses (typically automatically generated on GitHub)
* The description should contain additional required details, which typically reflect the content of the first PR comment
* A full link to the pull request should be added via a line: `Pull request: <link>`
* If the PR has multiple authors but is merged as merge commit, those authors should be included via a line for each co-author: `Co-authored-by: <author>`
* If the message contains links to other issues or pull requests, you should use full URLs to reference them
