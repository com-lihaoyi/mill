Garbage collectors are a core part of many programming languages. While they generally work
well, on occasion when they go wrong they can fail in very unintuitive ways.
This article will discuss the fundamental design of how garbage collectors
work, and tie it to real benchmarks of how GCs perform on the Java Virtual Machine. You
should come away with a deeper understanding of how the JVM garbage collector works and
concrete ways you can work to improve its performance in your own real-world projects.

For TL,DR see the <<GC Performance Takeaways>> section at the end.

## A Theoretical Garbage Collector

To understand how real-world JVM garbage collectors works, it is best to start
by looking at a simple example garbage collector. This will both give an intuition
for how things work in general, and also help you notice when things diverge from this
idealized example.

### Process Memory

At its core, a garbage collector helps manage the free memory of a program, often called the
_heap_. The memory of a program can be modelled as a linear sequence of storage locations, e.g.
below where we have 16 slots in memory:

```graphviz
digraph G {
  
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  heap [shape=record label="HEAP | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> | <f8> | <f9> | <f10> | <f11> | <f12> | <f13> | <f14> | <f15>"]

  heap:f0:s -> alloc:n [dir=back, style=dotted]
  alloc [label = "free memory", shape=plaintext]
}
```

These storage locations can contain objects (below named `foo`, `bar`, `qux`, `baz`) that take
up memory and may reference other objects (solid arrows). Furthermore, the values may be referenced from outside
the heap (dashed lines), e.g. from the "stack" which represents
local variables in methods that are currently being run (shown below) or from static global
variables (not shown). We keep a `free-memory` pointer to the first empty slot on the right.


```graphviz
digraph G {
  
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  heap [shape=record label="HEAP | <f0> foo | <f1> bar | <f2> qux | <f3> baz | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> | <f8> | <f9> | <f10> | <f11> | <f12> | <f13> | <f14> | <f15>"]
  heap:f0:s -> heap:f1:s
  heap:f0:s -> heap:f2:s
  heap:f2:n -> heap:f3:n
  heap:f4:s -> alloc:n [dir=back, style=dotted]
  alloc [label = "free memory", shape=plaintext]

  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  stack:f0 -> heap:f1 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  stack:f1 -> heap:f2 [dir=none, style=dashed]
}
```

If we want to allocate a new object `new1`, we can simply put it at the location of
the `free-memory` pointer (green below), and bump the pointer 1 slot to the right

```graphviz
digraph G {

  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  heap [shape=record label="HEAP | <f0> foo | <f1> bar | <f2> qux | <f3> baz | <f4> new1 | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> | <f8> | <f9> | <f10> | <f11> | <f12> | <f13> | <f14> | <f15>"]
  heap:f0:s -> heap:f1:s
  heap:f0:s -> heap:f2:s
  heap:f2:n -> heap:f3:n
  heap:f5:s -> alloc:n [dir=back, style=dotted]
  alloc [label = "free memory", shape=plaintext]

  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  stack:f0 -> heap:f1 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  stack:f1 -> heap:f2 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  stack:f2 -> heap:f4 [dir=none, style=dashed,  color=green, penwidth=3]
}
```

Similarly, objects may stop being referenced, e.g. `bar` below no longer has a reference
pointing at it from the stack. This may happen because a local variable on the stack is
set to `null`, or because a method call returned and the local variables associated with
it are no longer necessary


```graphviz
digraph G {

  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  heap [shape=record label="HEAP | <f0> foo | <f1> bar | <f2> qux | <f3> baz | <f4> new1 | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> | <f8> | <f9> | <f10> | <f11> | <f12> | <f13> | <f14> | <f15>"]
  heap:f0:s -> heap:f1:s
  heap:f0:s -> heap:f2:s
  heap:f2:n -> heap:f3:n
  heap:f5:s -> alloc:n [dir=back, style=dotted]
  alloc [label = "free memory", shape=plaintext]

  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  stack:f1 -> heap:f2 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  stack:f2 -> heap:f4 [dir=none, style=dashed]
}
```

For the purposes of this example, we show all objects on the heap taking up 1 slot, but
in real programs the size of each object may vary depending on the fields it has
or if it's a variable-length array.

### A Simple Garbage Collector

The simplest kind of garbage collector splits the 16-slot heap we saw earlier into
two 8-slot halves. If we want to allocate 4 more objects (`new2`, to `new5`), but
there are only 3 slots left in that half of the heap, we will need to do a collection:

```graphviz
digraph G {
  
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  {rank=same; heap1; heap2}
  heap2 [shape=record label="HALF2 | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3>  | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]

  heap1 [shape=record label="HALF1 | <f0> foo | <f1> bar | <f2> baz | <f3> qux | <f4> new1 | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  heap1:f0:s -> heap1:f1:s
  heap1:f0:s -> heap1:f2:s
  heap1:f2:n -> heap1:f3:n
  heap1:f5:s -> alloc:n [dir=back, style=dotted]
  alloc [label = "free memory", shape=plaintext]

  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  stack:f1 -> heap1:f2 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  stack:f2 -> heap1:f4 [dir=none, style=dashed]
}
```

To do a collection, the GC first starts from all non-heap
references (e.g. the `STACK` references above) often called "GC roots". It then traces
the graph of references, highlighted red below:

```graphviz
digraph G {
  
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  {rank=same; heap1; heap2}
  heap2 [shape=record label="HALF2 | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3>  | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]

  heap1 [shape=record label="HALF1 | <f0> foo | <f1> bar | <f2> qux | <f3> baz | <f4> new1| <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  heap1:f0:s -> heap1:f1:s
  heap1:f0:s -> heap1:f2:s
  heap1:f2:n -> heap1:f3:n [color=red, penwidth=3]
  heap1:f5:s -> alloc:n [dir=back, style=dotted]
  alloc [label = "free memory", shape=plaintext]
  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  stack:f1 -> heap1:f2 [dir=none, style=dashed, color=red, penwidth=3]
  stack:f2 -> heap1:f4 [dir=none, style=dashed, color=red, penwidth=3]
}
```

Here, we can see that `foo` is not referenced ("garbage"), `qux` and `new1` are referenced directly from the
`STACK`, and `baz` is referenced indirectly from `qux`. `bar` is referenced by `foo`, but
because `foo` is itself garbage we can count `bar` as garbage as well.

We then copy all objects we traced (often called the _live-set_) from `HALF1` to `HALF2`, adjust all the references
appropriately. Now `HALF2` is the half of the heap in use, and `HALF1` can be reset to empty.


```graphviz
digraph G {

  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  {rank=same; heap1; heap2}
  heap2 [shape=record label="HALF2 | <f0> qux | <f1> baz | <f2> new1 | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7>"]

  heap1 [shape=record label="HALF1 | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  heap2:f0:s -> heap2:f1:s [color=red, penwidth=3]

  heap2:f2:s -> alloc:n [dir=back, style=dotted]
  alloc [label = "free memory", shape=plaintext]
  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  stack:f0 -> heap2:f0 [dir=none, style=dashed, color=red, penwidth=3]
  stack:f1 -> heap2:f2 [dir=none, style=dashed, color=red, penwidth=3]
}
```

This collection has freed up 5 slots, so we now have space to allocate the
4 `new2` to `new5` objects we wanted (green) starting from our `free-memory` pointer:

```graphviz
digraph G {
  
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  {rank=same; heap1; heap2}
  heap2 [shape=record label="HALF2 | <f0> qux | <f1> baz | <f2> new1 | <f3> new2 | <f4> new3 | <f5> new4 | <f6> new5 | <f7>"]

  heap1 [shape=record label="HALF1 | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  heap2:f0:s -> heap2:f1:s 
  heap2:f3:n -> heap2:f4:n [color=green, penwidth=3]
  heap2:f4:s -> heap2:f5:s [color=green, penwidth=3]

  heap2:f7:s -> alloc:n [dir=back, style=dotted]
  alloc [label = "free memory", shape=plaintext]
  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  stack:f0 -> heap2:f0 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  stack:f1 -> heap2:f2 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  stack:f2 -> heap2:f3 [dir=none, style=dashed, color=green, penwidth=3]
  stack:f6 -> heap2:f6 [dir=none, style=dashed, color=green, penwidth=3]
}
```

You may notice that the objects `foo` and `bar` disappeared. This is because `foo` and `bar`
were not referenced directly or indirectly by any GC roots: they were unreachable, and thus
considered "garbage". These garbage objects were
not explicitly deleted, but  simply did not get copied over from `HALF1` to `HALF2`
during collection, and thus were wiped out when `HALF1` was cleared.

As your program executes, the methods actively running may change, and thus the references
(both from stack to heap and between entries on your heap) may change. For example, we may
stop referencing `qux`, which also means that `baz` is now unreachable:

```graphviz
digraph G {
  
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  {rank=same; heap1; heap2}
  heap2 [shape=record label="HALF2 | <f0> qux | <f1> baz | <f2> new1 | <f3> new2 | <f4> new3 | <f5> new4 | <f6> new5 | <f7>"]

  heap1 [shape=record label="HALF1 | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  heap2:f0:s -> heap2:f1:s
  alloc [label = "free memory", shape=plaintext]
  heap2:f7:s -> alloc:n [dir=back, style=dotted]
  heap2:f3:n -> heap2:f4:n
  heap2:f4:s -> heap2:f5:s
  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]

  stack:f1 -> heap2:f2 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  stack:f2 -> heap2:f3 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  stack:f6 -> heap2:f6 [dir=none, style=dashed]


}
```

Although `qux` and `baz` are now "garbage", they still take up space in the heap. Thus, if we want
to allocate two new objects (e.g. `new6` and `new7`), and there is only one slot left on the heap (above),
we need to repeat the garbage collection process: tracing
the objects transitively reachable (`new1`, `new2`, `new3`, `new4`, `new5`), copying them
from `HALF2` to `HALF1`,
adjusting any references to now use `HALF1` as the new heap, and clearing anything that was left
behind in `HALF2`. This then gives us enough space to allocate `new6` and `new7` (below in green):

```graphviz
digraph G {
  
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  {rank=same; heap1; heap2}
  heap2 [shape=record label="HALF2 | <f0> | <f1>  | <f2>  | <f3>  | <f4> | <f5> | <f6>  | <f7>  "]

  heap1 [shape=record label="HALF1 | <f0> new1 | <f1> new2 | <f2> new3 | <f3> new4 | <f4> new5 | <f5> new6 | <f6> new7 | <f7> "]
  heap1:f1:n -> heap1:f2:n [color=red, penwidth=3]
  heap1:f2:s -> heap1:f3:s [color=red, penwidth=3]
  heap1:f5:s -> heap1:f6:s [color=green, penwidth=3]

  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]

  stack:f0 -> heap1:f0 [dir=none, style=dashed, color=red, penwidth=3]
  stack:f1 -> heap1:f1 [dir=none, style=dashed, color=red, penwidth=3]

  stack:f4 -> heap1:f4 [dir=none, style=dashed, color=red, penwidth=3, constraint=false]
  stack:f5 -> heap1:f5 [dir=none, style=dashed, color=green, penwidth=3]

  heap1:f7:s -> alloc:n [dir=back, style=dotted]
  alloc [label = "free memory", shape=plaintext]
}
```

This process can repeat as many times as necessary: as long as there are _some_ objects
that are unreachable, you can run a collection and copy the "live" objects to the other
half of the heap, freeing up some space to allocate new objects. The only reason this
may fail is that if you run a collection and there _still_ isn't enough space to allocate
the objects you want; that means your program  has run out of memory, and will fail with
an `OutOfMemoryError` or similar.

Even this simplistic GC has a lot of interesting properties, and you may have heard these
terms or labels that can apply to it:

* *semi-space* garbage collector, because of the way it splits the heap into two halves

* *copying* garbage collector, because it needs to copy the heap objects back and forth
  between `HALF1` and `HALF2`

* *tracing* garbage collector, because of the way it traverses the graph of heap
  references in order to decide what to copy.

* *stop the world* garbage collector, because while this whole trace-copy-update-references
  workflow is happening, we have to stop the program to avoid race conditions between the garbage
  collector and the program code.

* *compacting* garbage collector, because every time we run a GC, we copy everything to the
  left-most memory, avoiding the memory fragmentation that occurs with other memory
  management techniques such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting[Reference Counting].

Most modern GCs are considerably more complicated than this: e.g. they may have optimizations
to avoid wasting half the heap by leaving it empty, or they may have
xref:_generational_optimizations[optimizations for handling short-lived objects], but at
their heart this is still what they do. And understanding the performance characteristics of
this simple, naive GC can help give you an intuition in how GCs compare to other memory management
strategies, and how modern GCs behave in terms of performance.



## Compared to Reference Counting

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting[Reference Counting] is another popular
memory management strategy that Garbage Collection is often compared to. Reference counting
works by keeping track of how many incoming references each object has, and when that
number reaches zero the object can be collected. This approach has a few major differences
from that of a tracing GC. We discuss a few of them below:

### Reference counting does not compact the heap

Program that use reference
counting tend to find their heap getting more and more fragmented over time
We can see this in the heap diagrams: the tracing garbage collector heaps above always had a
single block of empty space to the right, and had the `new` objects allocated in ascending order
from left-to-right:

```graphviz
digraph G {

  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  heap1 [shape=record label="HEAP | <f0> new1 | <f1> new2 | <f2> new3 | <f3> new4 | <f4> new5 | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> | <f8> | <f9> | <f10> | <f11> | <f12> | <f13> | <f14> | <f15>"]

  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]

  stack:f0 -> heap1:f0 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  stack:f1 -> heap1:f1 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  heap1:f1:n -> heap1:f2:n
  heap1:f2:s -> heap1:f3:s
  stack:f4 -> heap1:f4 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  heap1:f5:s -> alloc:n [dir=back, style=dotted]
  alloc [label = "free memory", shape=plaintext]
}
```


In contrast,
reference counted heaps (e.g. below) tend to get fragmented, with free space scattered about,
and the allocated objects jumbled up in no particular order


```graphviz
digraph G {

  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  heap [shape=record label="HEAP | <f0> new2 | <f1> new3 | <f2>  | <f3>  | <f4> new1 | <f5> new4 | <f6> new5 | <f7> | <f8> | <f9> | <f10> | <f11> | <f12> | <f13> | <f14> | <f15>"]

  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  stack:f0 -> heap:f4 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  stack:f1 -> heap:f0 [dir=none, style=dashed]
  heap:f0:n -> heap:f1:n
  heap:f1:s -> heap:f5:s
  stack:f4 -> heap:f6 [dir=none, style=dashed]
}
```


There are two main ways this affect performance:

* With garbage collection all the free memory is always on the right in one contiguous block,
  so an allocation just involves putting the object at the `free-pointer` location and moving
  `free-pointer` one slot to the right. Furthermore, newly allocated objects (which tend to
  be used together) are placed next to each other, making them more cache-friendly and
  improving access performance

* With reference counting objects are usually freed in-place, meaning that the free space is
  scattered throughout the heap, and you may need to scan the entire heap from left-to-right
  in order to find a spot to allocate something. There are data structures and algorithms that
  can make allocation faster than a linear scan, but they will never be as fast as the single
  pointer lookup necessary with a GC

### Reference counting cannot collect cycles

Objects that reference each other cyclically can thus
cause memory leaks when their objects never get collected, resulting in the program running
out of memory even though much of the heap could be cleaned up by a tracing garbage collector.


For example, consider the following heap, identical to the one we started with, but with an
additional edge from `bar` to `foo` (green), and with the edge from the stack to `bar` removed:


```graphviz
digraph G {

  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  heap [shape=record label="HEAP | <f0> foo | <f1> bar | <f2> qux | <f3> baz | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> | <f8> | <f9> | <f10> | <f11> | <f12> | <f13> | <f14> | <f15>"]
  heap:f0:s -> heap:f1:s
  heap:f1:n -> heap:f0:n [penwidth=3 color=green]
  heap:f0:s -> heap:f2:s
  heap:f2:n -> heap:f3:n [color=red, penwidth=3]

  stack [shape=record label="STACK | <f0> | <f1> | <f2> | <f3> | <f4> | <f5> | <f6> | <f7> "]
  stack:f1 -> heap:f2 [dir=none, style=dashed, color=red, penwidth=3]
}
```

* With reference counting, even though `foo` and `bar` cannot be reached by any external reference -
they are "garbage" - each one still has a reference pointing at it from the other. Thus
they will never get collected

* But with a tracing garbage collector, a collection can traverse the reference graph (red),
and copy `qux` and `baz` to the other half of the heap, leaving `foo` and `bar` behind as garbage,
despite the reference cycle between them

_Garbage Collection_ and _Reference Counting_ have very different characteristics, and neither
is strictly superior to the other in all scenarios.
Many programming languages (e.g. Python) that use reference counting also have a backup
tracing garbage collector that runs once in a while to clean up unreachable reference cycles
and compact the heap, and most modern GCs (e.g. ZGC discussed below) use some reference-counting
techniques as part of their implementation.


## Theoretical GC Performance

Typically, GC performance focuses on two main aspects:

- *Overhead*: what % of the time your program is spent collecting garbage, rather than
  real work. Lower is better
- *Pause Times*: what is the longest time your program is completely paused while
  collecting garbage. Lower is better


These two metrics are separate:

* *Some programs only care about throughput*, e.g. if you only care about how long a big batch
  analysis takes to complete, and don't care if it pauses in the middle to GC: you just want
  it to finish as soon as possible
* *Other programs only care about pause times*, e.g. someone playing a videogame doesn't care if
  it can run faster than their eye can perceive, but they do care that it does not freeze or
  pause for noticeable amounts of time while you are playing it

Even from the limited description above, we can already make some interesting inferences
about how the performance of a simple garbage collector will be like.

1. *Allocations in garbage collectors are _cheap_*: when the heap is not yet full, we can
   just allocate things on the first empty slots on the right side of the heap and bump `free-pointer`,
   without having to scan the heap to find empty slots.

2. *Pause times should be proportional to the size of the live-set*. That is because
   a collection involves tracing, copying, then updating the references within the live-set.

3. *Pause times would _not_ depend on the amount of garbage to be collected*. The collection
   we looked at above spend no time at all looking at or scanning for garbage objects,
   they simply all disappeared when their half of the heap was wiped out following a collection.

4. *Interval between collections is inversely proportional to free memory*.
   We only need to run a collection when the garbage we allocate fills up the "extra" heap memory
   our program has on top of what is necessary to store the live-set.

5. *GC overhead is the pause time divided by the interval, or proportional
   to the extra memory and inversely proportional to the live-set size and heap size*

In other words:

* `allocation_cost = O(1)`

* `gc_pause_time = O(live-set)`

* `gc_interval = O(heap-size - live-set)`

* `gc_overhead = gc_pause_time / gc_interval`

* `gc_overhead = O(live-set / (heap-size - live-set))`

Even from this small conclusions, we can already see some unintuitive results:

1. *More memory does _not_ reduce pause times!* `gc_pause_time = O(live-set)`, and so
   pause times do not depend on how much `heap-size` you have.

2. *There is no point at which providing more memory does not improve GC overhead!*
   `gc_overhead = O(live-set / (heap-size - live-set))`, so
   providing larger and larger ``heap-size``s means less and less GC overhead, meaning a
   larger % of your program time is spent on useful work.

3. *Conversely, providing exactly as much memory as the program requires_ is the worst
   case possible!* `gc_overhead = O(live-set / (heap-size - live-set))` when
   `heap-size = live-set` means `gc_interval = 0` and `gc_overhead = infinity`:
   the program will constantly need to run an expensive collections and have no time left
   to do actual work. Garbage collectors therefore _need_ excess memory to work with, on top
   of the memory you would expect to need to allocate all the objects in your program.

Even from this theoretical analysis, we have already found a number of surprising results
in how GCs perform over time. Let's now see how this applies to some real-world garbage
collectors included with the Java Virtual Machine

## Benchmarking JVM Garbage Collectors

Now that we have run through a theoretical introduction and analysis of how GCs work
and how we would expect them to perform, let's look at some small Java programs and
monitor how garbage collection happens when using them. For this benchmark, we'll
be using the following Java program:

- xref:attachment$GC.java[GC.java]

This is a small Java program designed to do a rough benchmark of Java garbage collection
performance. For each benchmark, it:

1. Starts off allocating a bunch of `int[]` arrays of varying size in `liveSet`, on
   average taking up 1000 bytes each.

2. Loops continuously to allocate more ``int[]``s and over-writes the references
   to older ones

3. Tracks how long each allocation takes to run: ideally it should be almost instant, but if
   that allocation triggers a GC it may take some time

4. Lastly, we print out the two numbers we care about
   in a GC: the `maxPause` time in milliseconds, and the `throughput` it is able to handle
   in megabytes per second (`throughput` being the opposite of `overhead` we mentioned earlier).

To be clear, this benchmark is _rough_. Performance will vary between runs, and on what hardware
and software you run it (I ran it on a M1 Macbook Pro running Java 23). But the results should be
clear even if the exact numbers will differ between runs.

You can run this program via:

```bash
> javac -Xmx1g GC.java 800 10000 5 # Default is -XX:+UseG1GC
> javac -Xmx1g -XX:+UseParallelGC GC.java 800 10000 5
> javac -Xmx1g -XX:+UseZGC GC.java 800 10000 5
```

Above, `-Xmx1g` sets the heap size, the `-XX:` flags set the garbage collector, 800 sets
the `liveSet` size (in megabytes), and `10000` and `5` set the duration and number of
iterations to run the benchmark (here 10 seconds, 5 iterations). The measured pause times
and allocation rate are averaged over those 5 iterations.

I used the following Java program to run the benchmark for a
range of inputs to collect the numbers shown below:

### G1 Garbage Collector Benchmarks

Running this on the default GC (G1), we get the followings numbers:

*Pause Times*
[%autowidth.stretch, cols=">,>,>,>,>,>"]
|===
| live-set\heap-size | 800 mb | 1600 mb | 3200 mb | 6400 mb | 12800 mb
| 400 mb | 39 ms | 48 ms | 74 ms | 63 ms | 90 ms
| 800 mb |  | 72 ms | 82 ms | 144 ms | 165 ms
| 1600 mb |  |  | 129 ms | 137 ms | 267 ms
| 3200 mb |  |  |  | 248 ms | 307 ms
| 6400 mb |  |  |  |  | 624 ms
|===

*Throughput*
[%autowidth.stretch, cols=">,>,>,>,>,>"]
|===
| live-set\heap-size | 800 mb | 1600 mb | 3200 mb | 6400 mb | 12800 mb
| 400 mb | 3238 mb/s | 3938 mb/s | 5329 mb/s | 5198 mb/s | 5410 mb/s
| 800 mb |  | 3180 mb/s | 3765 mb/s | 4602 mb/s | 4550 mb/s
| 1600 mb |  |  | 3046 mb/s | 3632 mb/s | 3777 mb/s
| 3200 mb |  |  |  | 3000 mb/s | 3148 mb/s
| 6400 mb |  |  |  |  | 2618 mb/s
|===

As mentioned earlier, garbage collectors require some amount of free space in order to
work well, and so we only ran the benchmarks where the `heap-size` was twice or more
of the `live-set` size.

Above, we can see the behavior we discussed earlier in the theoretical performance analysis:

1. *GC pause times go up as the size of the live set increases*. With a `800 mb` heap and
   `400 mb` live set the average pause time is `39 ms`, and it scales smoothly up to a
   `6400 mb` heap and `3200 mb` live set where the pause time is `624 ms`

2. *GC pause times are relatively constant regardless of the heap size*.
   e.g. for `400 mb` live set a `800 mb` heap has a `39 ms` pause time, while a `400 mb` live set and
   `6400 mb` heap (8 times as large!) has a `90 ms` pause time. In fact, increasing the heap
   size while keeping other things constant seems to make pause times go up slightly in
   this benchmark!

3. *GC throughput goes up as the heap size increases*, e.g. for a `400 mb` live set it goes
   smoothly from `3238 mb/s` for a `800 mb` heap to a `5410 mb/s` pause time for a `6400 mb`
   heap.


### Generational Optimizations

One additional GC behavior worth discussing is the "Generational Hypothesis".
The idea is that _"most"_ objects do not live a long time, e.g. objects allocated within a method are often
collect when the method returns. Given that assumption, many GCs have made optimizations
for the collection of objects that become garbage quickly, such that collecting them is
much cheaper. Practically, that means that the same `live-set` and `heap-size` can have
vastly different performance depending on how the allocations are structured:

1. "Least Recently Used" garbage collections, where the _oldest_ objects are the ones that
   get collected, will perform the worst

2. "Most Recently Used" garbage collections, where the _newest_ objects are the ones that
   get collected, will perform the best

Notable, "LRU" is one of the most common caching strategies, which it is possible
for in-memory caches with LRU cache eviction to make GC problems worse!

The example Java benchmark above keeps objects around a while before they become garbage,
by assigning new allocations to randomly indices in the `liveSet` array.
We can instead always assign new allocations to indices via a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk[Random Walk]:
randomly adjacent to the left or right of the previously-assigned allocation, meaning
that recently allocated objects are likely to be over-written (becoming unreachable and
eligible for garbage collection) more quickly by newer allocations
in the same part of `liveSet`, while older objects in other parts of `liveSet` are less
likely to be become unreachable. This lets us emulate the "generational" behavior that
is common in real-world programs:

```diff
-liveSetIndex = random.nextInt(liveSetSize);
+liveSetIndex += (random.nextBoolean() ? 1 : -1) + liveSetSize;
+liveSetIndex %= liveSetSize;
```


If we do this and measure the pause times and throughput of the example program,
we get the following:

*Pause Times*
[%autowidth.stretch, cols=">,>,>,>,>,>"]
|===
| live-set\heap-size | 800 mb | 1600 mb | 3200 mb | 6400 mb | 12800 mb
| 400 mb | 4 ms | 3 ms | 2 ms | 4 ms | 2 ms
| 800 mb |  | 3 ms | 3 ms | 12 ms | 3 ms
| 1600 mb |  |  | 5 ms | 10 ms | 4 ms
| 3200 mb |  |  |  | 13 ms | 11 ms
| 6400 mb |  |  |  |  | 22 ms
|===

*Throughput*
[%autowidth.stretch, cols=">,>,>,>,>,>"]
|===
| live-set\heap-size | 800 mb | 1600 mb | 3200 mb | 6400 mb | 12800 mb
| 400 mb | 7218 mb/s | 7495 mb/s | 7536 mb/s | 7550 mb/s | 7634 mb/s
| 800 mb |  | 7497 mb/s | 7790 mb/s | 7580 mb/s | 7819 mb/s
| 1600 mb |  |  | 7563 mb/s | 7464 mb/s | 7830 mb/s
| 3200 mb |  |  |  | 7128 mb/s | 5854 mb/s
| 6400 mb |  |  |  |  | 3286 mb/s
|===


Where the previous random-allocation benchmark has pause times of 10s to 100s to 1000s of
milliseconds, this "generational" benchmark has pause times in the 1s to 10s. The program
throughput is also significantly higher.
This demonstrates that the default G1 garbage collector does in fact have optimizations that
make it perform better for "generational" workloads.

Most GCs have some kind of optimization to make collecting recently-allocated objects
cheaper than collecting long-lived objects; these are often called _generational_
garbage collectors. Java's G1GC is no different, and we can see that even with
the same live-set size and heap sizes, shorter-lived objects are dramatically
cheaper to collect than long-lived objects.


### Z Garbage Collector Benchmarks

One interesting development in JVM garbage collectors is the
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/gctuning/z-garbage-collector.html[Z Garbage Collector].
This is a garbage collector that is optimized for lower pause times, exchange for requiring
much more memory than the default G1GC. If we run the benchmarks above with ZGC,
even without the <<Generational Optimizations>>, we get the numbers below:

*Pause Times*
[%autowidth.stretch, cols=">,>,>,>,>,>"]
|===
| live-set\heap-size | 800 mb | 1600 mb | 3200 mb | 6400 mb | 12800 mb
| 400 mb | 39 ms | 12 ms | 1 ms | 1 ms | 1 ms
| 800 mb |  | 63 ms | 1 ms | 1 ms | 3 ms
| 1600 mb |  |  | 208 ms | 9 ms | 1 ms
| 3200 mb |  |  |  | 378 ms | 2 ms
| 6400 mb |  |  |  |  | 701 ms
|===

*Throughput*
[%autowidth.stretch, cols=">,>,>,>,>,>"]
|===
| live-set\heap-size | 800 mb | 1600 mb | 3200 mb | 6400 mb | 12800 mb
| 400 mb | 2428 mb/s | 4130 mb/s | 5139 mb/s | 5647 mb/s | 5943 mb/s
| 800 mb |  | 2587 mb/s | 3920 mb/s | 4776 mb/s | 4975 mb/s
| 1600 mb |  |  | 2383 mb/s | 3513 mb/s | 4088 mb/s
| 3200 mb |  |  |  | 2282 mb/s | 3186 mb/s
| 6400 mb |  |  |  |  | 2304 mb/s
|===

Some things worth noting with ZGC:

1. In the lower `heap-size` benchmarks - with `heap-size` twice `live-set` - ZGC
has worse pause times than the default G1GC (10s to 100s of milliseconds) but
and worse throughput (`2300-2600 mb/s` rather than the `2800-3100 mb/s` of G1GC)

2. For larger ``heap-size``s - 4 times the `live-set` and above - ZGC's pause times drop to
single-digit milliseconds (1-10 ms), much lower than those of G1GC

As mentioned in the discussion on <<Theoretical GC Performance>>, for
most garbage collectors pause times are proportional to the live set, and increasing the
heap size does not help at all (and according to our <<G1 Garbage Collector Benchmarks>>, may
even make things worse!). This can be problematic, because there are many use cases that
cannot tolerate long GC pause times, but at the same time may require a significant amount
of live data to be kept in memory, so shrinking the live-set is not possible.

ZGC provides an option here, where if you are willing to provide _significantly_
more memory than the default G1GC requires, perhaps twice as much, you can get your
pause times from 10-100s of milliseconds down to 1-2 milliseconds. These pause times
remain low for a wide range of heap sizes and live set sizes, and can be beneficial
for a lot of applications that cannot afford to just randomly stop for 100ms at a time.
But the extra memory requirement means it's not a strict improvement, and it really
depends on your use case whether the tradeoff is worth it.


## GC Performance Takeaways


Now that we've studied garbage collections in theory, and looked at some concrete
numbers, there are some interesting conclusions. First, the unintuitive things:

1. *Adding more memory does _not improve_ GC pause times*. It may even make things worse!
   This is perhaps the most unintuitive thing about garbage collectors: it seems so
   obvious that problems with memory management would be solved by adding more memory,
   but we can see from our theoretical analysis above why that is not the case,
   and we verified that empirically in benchmarks.

2. *Caching data _in-process_ can make garbage collection pause times _worse_!* If
   you have problems with GC pause times then caching things in-memory will
   increase the size of your _live-set_ and therefore make your pause times even worse!
   "LRU" caches in particular are the worst case for garbage collectors, which are typically
   optimized for collecting recently-allocated short-lived objects.
   In contrast, caching things _out of process_
   does not have this problem. Caching can be worthwhile to reduce redundant computation,
   but it is not a solution to garbage collection problems.

3. *There will never be an _exact_ amount of memory that a garbage-collected application
   needs.* You can _always_ reduce-overhead/increase-throughput by providing more memory,
   to make GCs less and less frequent, leaving more time to do useful work. And you can
   usually provide less memory, at the cost of more and more frequent GCs. Exactly how much
   memory to provide is thus something you tweak and tune rather than something you can
   calculate exactly.

4. *Fewer larger processes can have worse GC performance than more smaller processes!*
   There are many ways in which consolidating smaller processes into larger ones can
   improve efficiency: less per-process overhead, eliminating
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication[inter-process communication] cost,
   etc. But GC pause times scale with _total live set size_, so combining two smaller
   processes into one large one can make pause times _worse_ than they were before.
   Even if the large process does the same thing as the smaller processes, it can
   suffer from worse GC pause times.

5. *You can reduce pause times by reducing the _live-set_*. If you have very large
   in-process data structures, moving them somewhere else (e.g. into
   https://www.sqlite.org/[SQLite], https://github.com/redis/redis[Redis],
   or https://memcached.org/[Memcached]) would reduce the amount of objects the GC
   needs to trace and copy every collection, and reduce the pause times

6. *Shorter-lived objects are faster to collect*, due to most GCs being _generational_. This
   also ties into (1) above: caches tend to keep lots of long-lived objects in memory, which
   apart from slowing down collections due to the size of the live-set, _also_ slows them down
   by missing out on the GC's optimizations for short-lived objects.

7. *Switch to the Z garbage collector lets you trade off memory for pause times.*
   JVM programs are by default already very memory hungry compared to other languages
   (Go, Rust, etc.) and ZGC requires perhaps another 2x as much memory to work. But
   if you are willing to pay the cost, ZGC can bring pause times down from 50-500ms
   down to 1-5ms, which may make a big different for latency-sensitive applications.


The Java benchmarks above were run on one particular set of hardware on one version
of the JVM, and the exact numbers will differ when run on other hardware or JVM versions.
Nevertheless, the overall trends that you can see would remain the same, as would the
take-aways of what you need to know to understand garbage collector performance.


## Conclusion

Garbage collectors can be complicated, differing in design
and implementation between languages (Python, Java, Go, etc.) and even within the same
language (Java's https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/gctuning/parallel-collector1.html[ParallelGC],
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/gctuning/garbage-first-g1-garbage-collector1.html[G1GC],
the newer https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/gctuning/z-garbage-collector.html[ZGC], etc.).
There are endless clever optimizations for the language designers to implement and knobs
for language users to tweak and tune.

However, at a high level most GCs are actually surprisingly similar, have the same
odd performance characteristics, and the same surprising pitfalls.
Hopefully this article will have given you a good intuition for how garbage collectors work and behave, so
next time you need to do something with your GC you have a solid understanding to work with.
