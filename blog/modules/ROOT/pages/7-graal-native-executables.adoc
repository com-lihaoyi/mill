One recent development in the last few years is the ability to compile Java
applications into self-contained "Graal native image" binaries that can be run
directly from the command line. This provides more convenient single-file
distributions, faster startup time, and lower memory footprint. This article
will discuss how you can get started building Java native executables using
the Mill build tool, the benefits they may bring, and the issues you may
encounter.
