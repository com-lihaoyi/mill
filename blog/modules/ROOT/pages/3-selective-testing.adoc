Selective testing is a key technique necessary for working with any large codebase
or monorepo: picking which tests to run to validate a change or pull-request, because
running every test every time is costly and slow. This blog post will explore what
selective testing is all about, the different approaches you can take with selective
testing, based on my experience working on developer tooling and CI for the last decade at
Dropbox and Databricks. Lastly, we will discuss
xref:mill::large/selective-execution.adoc[how the Mill build tool supports selective testing].

## Large Codebases

Although codebases can be large, in any large codebase you are typically only working on
a fraction of it at any point in time. As an example that we will use throughout this
article, consider a large codebase or monorepo that contains the code for:

1. 3 backend services: `backend_service_1`, `backend_service_2`, `backend_service_3`
2. 2 frontend web codebases: `frontend_web_1`, `frontend_web_2`
3. 1 `backend_service_utils` module, and 1 `frontend_web_utils` module
4. 3 deployments: `deployment_1`, `deployment_2`, `deployment_3`, that make use of the
   backend services and frontend web codebases.
5. The three deployments may be combined into a `staging_environment`, which is then
   used in three sets of ``end_to_end_test``s, one for each deployment

These modules may depend on each other as shown in the diagram below,
with the various `backend_service` and `frontend_web` codebases
grouped into `deployments`, and the `_utils` files shared between them:

```graphviz
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]

  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_2 -> deployment_2
  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_1 -> deployment_1

  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_3 -> deployment_3
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_2 -> deployment_2
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_1 -> deployment_1
  deployment_1 -> staging_environment
  deployment_2 -> staging_environment
  deployment_3 -> staging_environment
  staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_1
  staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_2
  staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_3
}
```

These various modules would typically each have their own test suite, which
for simplicity I left out of the diagrams.

Although the codebase described above is just an example, it reflects the kind of
codebase structure that exists in many real-world codebases. Using this example,
let us now consider a few ways in which selective testing can be used.

## No Selective Testing

Most software projects start off naively running every test on every pull-request
to validate the changes. For small projects this is fine. Every project starts
small and most projects stay small, so this approach is not a problem at all.

However, for the projects that do continue growing, this strategy quickly
becomes infeasible:

* The size of the codebase (in number of modules, lines of code, or number of tests) grows
  linearly `O(n)` over time
* The number of tests necessary to validate any pull-request also grows linearly `O(n)`

This means that although the test runs may start off running quickly, they naturally slow
down over time:

* A week-old project may have a test suite that runs in seconds
* By a few months, the test suite may start taking minutes to run
* After a few years, the tests may be taking over an hour.
* And there is no upper bound: in a large growing project test runs can easily
  take several hours or even days to run

Although at a small scale waiting seconds or minutes for tests to run is not a problem,
the fact that it grows unbounded means it will _eventually_ become a problem on any growing
codebase. Large codebases with test suites taking 4-8 hours to run are not uncommon at all, and
this can become a real bottleneck in how fast developers can implement features or otherwise
improve the functionality of the codebase.

In general, "no selective testing" works fine for small projects with 1-10 developers, but
beyond that the inefficiency of running tests not relevant to your changes starts noticeably
slowing down day to day development. At that point, the first thing people reach for is
some kind of folder-based selective testing.


## Folder-based Selective Testing

Typically, in any large codebase, most work happens within a single part of it: e.g. a
developer may be working on `backend_service_1`, another may be working on `frontend_web_2`.
The obvious thing to do would be make sure each module is in its own folder, e.g.

```
my_repo/
    backend_service_1/
    backend_service_2/
    backend_service_3/
    frontend_web_1/
    frontend_web_2/
    backend_service_utils/
    frontend_web_utils/
    deployment_1/
    deployment_2/
    deployment_3/
    ...
```

To do simple module-based selective execution generally involves:

1. Run a `git diff` on the code change you want to validate
2. For any folders which contain changed files, run their tests

For example,

- A PR changing `backend_service_1/` will need to run the `backend_service_1/` tests
- A PR changing `frontend_web_2/` will need to run the `frontend_web_2/` tests

This does limit the number of tests any individual needs to execute: someone working on
`backend_service_1` does not need to run the tests for `backend_service_2`, `backend_service_3`,
etc.. This helps keep the test times when working on the monorepo from growing unbounded.

However, folder-based selective testing is not enough: it is possible that changing
a module would not break its own tests, but it could cause problems with downstream modules that
depend on it:

1. Changing `backend_service_1` may require corresponding changes to `frontend_web_1`, and
   if those changes are not coordinated the integration tests in `deployment_1` would fail

2. Changing `frontend_web_utils` could potentially break both `frontend_web_1` and `frontend_web_2`
   that depend on it, and thus we need to run the tests for both those modules to validate our change.

In these cases, the failure mode of folder-based selective testing is:

* You change code in a folder
* _That folder's_ tests may pass
* You merge your change into the main repository
* Only after merging, you notice _other folders' tests_ failing, which you did not
  notice up front because you didn't run their tests before merging. But because you
  merged the breaking change, you have inconvenienced other people working in other
  parts of the codebase
* You now have to tediously revert your breaking change, or rush
  a fix-forward to un-break the folders whose tests you broke, and unblock the developers
  working in those folders

Folder-based selective testing works fine for codebases with 10-100 developers: there are
occasional cases where a breakage might slip through, but generally it's infrequent enough
that it's tolerable. But as the development organization grows beyond 100, these breakages
affect more and more people and become more and more painful. To resolve this, we need
something more sophisticated.

## Dependency-based Selective Testing

To solve the problem of code changes potentially breaking downstream modules, we need to make
sure that for every code change, we run both the tests for that module as well as every downstream
test. For example, if we make a change to `backend_service_1`, we need to run the unit tests for
`backend_service_1` as well as the integration tests for `deployment_1`:


```graphviz
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]

  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_2 -> deployment_2
  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_1 -> deployment_1

  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_3 -> deployment_3
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_2 -> deployment_2

  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_1
  backend_service_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  deployment_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  backend_service_1 -> deployment_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
}
```

On the other hand, if we make a change to `frontend_web_utils`, we need to run the unit tests
for `frontend_web_1` and `frontend_web_2`, as well as the integration tests for `deployment_1`
and `deployment_2`, but _not_ `deployment_3` since (in this example) it doesn't depend on any frontend codebase:

```graphviz
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]
  frontend_web_utils [color=red, penwidth=2]
  frontend_web_2 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  deployment_2 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  frontend_web_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  deployment_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]

  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_1 -> deployment_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_2 -> deployment_2 [color=red, penwidth=2]

  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_3 -> deployment_3
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_2 -> deployment_2
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_1 -> deployment_1
}
```

This kind of dependency-based selective test execution is generally straightforward:

1. You need to know which modules own which source files (e.g. based on the folder),
2. You need to know which modules depend on which other modules
3. Run a `git diff` on the code change you want to validate
4. For any modules which contain changed files, run a breadth-first traversal of the module graph
5. For all the modules discovered during the traversal, run their tests

The algorithm (i.e. a breadth first search) is pretty trivial, the interesting part
is generally how you know _"which modules own which source files"_ and
_"which modules depend on which other modules"_.

* For smaller projects this can be
  managed manually in a bash or python script, e.g.
  https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/290b4b31bae2e02b648d2c5ef61183f337b18f8f/dev/sparktestsupport/modules.py#L108-L126[this code in Apache Spark]
  that manually maintains a list of source folders and dependencies per-module,
  as well as what command in the underlying build tool you need to run
  in order to test that module (`sbt_test_goals`):

```python
tags = Module(
    name="tags",
    dependencies=[],
    source_file_regexes=["common/tags/"],
)

utils = Module(
    name="utils",
    dependencies=[tags],
    source_file_regexes=["common/utils/"],
    sbt_test_goals=["common-utils/test"],
)

kvstore = Module(
    name="kvstore",
    dependencies=[tags],
    source_file_regexes=["common/kvstore/"],
    sbt_test_goals=["kvstore/test"],
)

...
```

* In a larger project maintaining this information by hand is tedious and error prone,
  so it is better to get the information from your build tool that already has it
  (e.g. via xref:mill::large/selective-execution.adoc[Mill Selective Execution]).

An alternate mechanism for achieving dependency-based selective testing is via caching
of test results, e.g. in tools like Bazel which support https://bazel.build/remote/caching[Remote Caching].
In this approach, rather than using `git diff` and a graph traversal to decide what tests
to run, we simply run every test and rely on the fact that tests that are run without
any changes to their upstream dependencies will re-use a version from the cache automatically.
Although the implementation is different, this caching-based approach largely has the
same behavioral and performance characteristics as the ``git diff``-based approach
to dependency-based selective testing.

### Limitations of Dependency-based Selective Testing

Dependency-based selective test execution can get you pretty far: 100s to 1,000 developers
working on a shared codebase. But it still has weaknesses, and as the number of
developers grows beyond 1,000, you begin noticing issues and inefficiency:

1. *You are limited by the granularity of your module graph*. For example,
   `backend_service_utils` may be used by all three ``backend_service``s,
   but not _all_ of `backend_service_utils` is used by all three services. Thus
   a change to `backend_service_utils` may result in running tests for all three
   ``backend_service``s, even if that change may not affect that particular service

2. *You may over-test things redundantly*. For example, a function in `backend_service_utils`
   may be exhaustively tested in ``backend_service_utils``'s own test suite. If so, running
   unit tests for all three ``backend_service``s
   as well as integration tests for all three ``deployment``s may be unnecessary, as they
   will just exercise code paths that are already exercised as part of the `backend_service_utils`
   test suite



These failure modes are especially problematic for integration or end-to-end tests.
The nature of end-to-end tests is that they depend on _everything_, and so you find
_any change_ in your codebase triggering _every end-to-end_test_ to be run. These
are also the slowest tests in your codebase, so running every end-to-end test every time
you touch any line of code is extremely expensive and wasteful.

For example, touching `backend_service_1` is enough to trigger all the `end_to_end` tests:

```graphviz
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]

  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_2 -> deployment_2
  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_1 -> deployment_1

  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_1
  backend_service_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  deployment_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  backend_service_1 -> deployment_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_2 -> deployment_2
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_3 -> deployment_3

  deployment_1 -> staging_environment
  deployment_2 -> staging_environment
  deployment_3 -> staging_environment
  staging_environment [color=red, penwidth=2]
  end_to_end_test_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  end_to_end_test_2 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  end_to_end_test_3 [color=red, penwidth=2]

  staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_2 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_3 [color=red, penwidth=2]
}
```

Touching `frontend_web_2` is also enough to trigger all the `end_to_end` tests:

```graphviz
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]



  frontend_web_2 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  frontend_web_2 -> deployment_2  [color=red, penwidth=2]
  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_1 -> deployment_1
  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_2
  deployment_2 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_1
  backend_service_1 -> deployment_1
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_2 -> deployment_2
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_3 -> deployment_3

  deployment_1 -> staging_environment
  deployment_2 -> staging_environment
  deployment_3 -> staging_environment
  staging_environment [color=red, penwidth=2]
  end_to_end_test_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  end_to_end_test_2 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  end_to_end_test_3 [color=red, penwidth=2]

  staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_2 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_3 [color=red, penwidth=2]
}
```

The two examples above demonstrate both failure modes:

1. `staging_environment` is very coarse grained, causing all ``end_to_end_test``s to be run
   even if they don't actually test the code in question

2. Every `end_to_end_test` likely exercises the same setup/teardown/plumbing code,
   in addition to the core logic under test, resulting in the same code being exercised
   redundantly by many different tests

This results in the selective testing system wasting both time and compute resources,
running tests that aren't relevant or repeatedly testing the same code paths over and over.
While there are some ways you can improve the granularity of the module graph to mitigate
these two issues, these issues are fundamental to dependency-based selective testing:

* Dependency-based Selective Testing means _a problematic code change cases all affected tests to break_
* For an effectivec CI system, all we need is that _every problematic code change breaks at least one test_

Fundamentally, CI just needs to ensure that every problematic code change breaks _at least one thing_,
because that is usually enough for the pull-request author to act on it and resolve the problem.
Running more tests to display more breakages is usually a waste of time and resources. Thus,
although dependency-based selective testing helps, it still falls short of the ideal of how a CI
system should behave.

## Heuristic-based Selective Testing

The next stage of selective testing that most teams encounter is using heuristics: these are
ad-hoc rules that you put in place to decide what tests to run based on a code change.
Common heuristics include:

### Limiting Dependency Depth

The chances
are that a breaking in module X will be caught by X's test suite, or the test suite of
X's direct downstream modules, so we don't need to run every single transitive downstream
module's test suite. e.g. if we set `N = 1`, then a change to `backend_service_1` shown below
will only run tests for `backend_service_1` and `deployment_1`, but not the ``end_to_end_test``s
downstream of the `staging_environment`:

```graphviz
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]

  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_2 -> deployment_2
  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_1 -> deployment_1

  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_1
  backend_service_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  deployment_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  backend_service_1 -> deployment_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_2 -> deployment_2
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_3 -> deployment_3

  deployment_1 -> staging_environment
  deployment_2 -> staging_environment
  deployment_3 -> staging_environment
  staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_1
  staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_2
  staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_3
}
```

At my last job, we picked `N = 8` somewhat arbitrarily, but as a heuristic there is
no "right" answer, and the exact choice can be chosen to tradeoff between thoroughness
and test latency. The principle here is that "most" code is tested
by its own tests and those of its direct dependencies, so running tests for downstream
folders which are too far removed in the dependency graph is "generally" not useful.

### Hard-coding Dependency Relationships

For example if I change `deployment_1`, I can choose to ignore the `staging_environment`
when finding downstream tests, and only run `end_to_end_test_1` since it is end-to-end
tests for the `deployment_1` module. We represent this by rendering `staging_environment`
in dashed lines below, and adding additional arrows representing the hard-coded dependency
from `deployment_1` to `end_to_end_test_1`:

```graphviz
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box width=0 height=0 style=filled fillcolor=white]

  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_2 -> deployment_2
  frontend_web_utils -> frontend_web_1 -> deployment_1

  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_3 -> deployment_3
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_2 -> deployment_2
  backend_service_utils -> backend_service_1

  backend_service_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  deployment_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  backend_service_1 -> deployment_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]


  deployment_3 -> staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_1 [style=dashed]

  deployment_2 -> staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_2 [style=dashed]
  deployment_1 -> staging_environment -> end_to_end_test_3 [style=dashed]
  staging_environment [style=dashed]


  deployment_1 -> end_to_end_test_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  end_to_end_test_1 [color=red, penwidth=2]
  end_to_end_test_2
  deployment_3 -> end_to_end_test_3
}
```

This approach does work, as developers usually have _some_ idea of what tests
should be run to exercise their application code. But maintaining these hard-coded
dependency relationships is difficult in a large and evolving codebase:

* Generally only the most senior engineers with the most experience working in the
  codebase are able to make such judgements

* The nature of heuristics is that there is no right or wrong answer, and it is difficult
  to determine whether a selection of hard-coded dependencies is good or not

Fundamentally, tweaking magic configuration values to try and optimize an unclear
result is not a good use of developer time, but in some cases doing so may be necessary 
in large codebases to keep pull-request validation time and cost under control.

### Machine-Learning-based Selective Testing

The last option I've seen in the wild is machine-learning based test selection. This
has two steps:

1. Train a machine learning model using the 10,000 commits on the codebase,
   with the `git diff` and any tests that were broken on.

2. For any new pull-request, feed the `git diff` into the model trained in (1) above
   to get a list of likely-affected tests, and only run those

This approach basically automates the manual tweaking described in
<<Hard-coding Dependency Relationships>>, and instead of some senior engineer trying to use
their intuition to guess what tests to run, the ML model does the same thing.
You can then easily tune the model to optimize for different tradeoffs between latency
and thoroughness, depending on what is important for your development team at any point in time.

One downside of machine-learning-based selective testing is the ML models are a black box,
and you have very little idea of why they do what they do. However, all of the heuristics
people use in <<Heuristic-based Selective Testing>> are effectively black boxes anyway,
since you'll be hard-pressed to come up with an answer for why someone
<<Limiting Dependency Depth>> decided to set `N = 8` rather than `7` or `9`, or why
someone <<Hard-coding Dependency Relationships>> decided on the exact hard-coded config they
ended up choosing.


### Limitations of Heuristics

The nature of heuristics is that they are _approximate_. That means that it is possible
both that we run too may tests and waste time, and also that we run too few tests and allow
a breakage to slip through. Typically this sort of heuristic is only used early in the testing
pipeline, e.g.

1. When validating pull-requests, use heuristics to trim down the set of tests to run before merging
2. After merging a pull-request, run a more thorough set of tests without heuristics
   to catch any bugs that slipped through and prevent bugs from being shipped to customers.
3. If a bug is noticed during post-merge testing, bisect it and revert/fix the offending commit

This may seem hacky and complicated, and bisecting/reverting commits post-merge can indeed
waste a lot of time. But such a workflow necessary in any large codebase and organization.
The heuristics also do not need to be 100% precise, and as long as they are precise _enough_ that
the time saved skipping tests outweighs the time spend dealing with post-merge breakages, it
still ends up being worth it.

## Selective Testing in Mill

The Mill build tool's xref:mill::large/selective-execution.adoc[Selective Test Execution]
supports <<Dependency-based Selective Testing>> out of the box. This makes it easy to set up
CI for your projects using Mill that only run tests that are downstream of the code
you changed in a pull-request. Selective Test Execution in Mill is implemented at the _task
level_, so even custom tasks and overrides can benefit from it. Mill's own pull-request
validation jobs benefit greatly for selective testing, and you can see documentation-only
pull-requests such as https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/pull/4175[#4175] basically 
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill/actions/runs/12482782465[skipping the entire test suite]
since it did not touch any files that could affect those tests.

However, although Mill provides better support for selective testing that most build tools
(which provide none), the <<Limitations of Dependency-based Selective Testing>> do cause issues.
Even in Mill's own pull-request validation jobs, the fact that the most expensive integration
or end-to-end tests are selected every time causes slowness. What kind of
<<Heuristic-based Selective Testing>> can help improve things remains an open question.

If you are interested in build tools, especially where they apply to selective testing on
large codebases and monorepos, you should definitely give the
https://mill-build.org/[Mill Build Tool] a try! Mill's support for selective testing can
definitely help you keep pull-request validation times reasonable in a large codebase or
monorepo, which is key to keeping developers productive and development velocity fast
even as the size and scope of a project grows.
