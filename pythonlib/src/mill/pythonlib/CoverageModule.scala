/**
 * Code coverage via Python's [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/)
 * package.
 *
 * ** Note that this is a helper trait, and you are unlikely to use this
 * directly. If you're looking for including coverage across tests in your
 * project, please use [[CoverageTests]] instead! **
 *
 * If you do want to use this module directly, please be aware that analyzing
 * code coverage introduces "non-linear" changes to the execution task flow, and
 * you will need to respect the following contract:
 *
 * 1. This trait defines a location where coverage data must be saved.
 *
 * 2. You need to define a `coverageTask` which is responsible for creating
 *    coverage data in the before mentioned location. How this is done is up to
 *    you. As an example, the [[CoverageTests]] module modifies `pythonOptions`
 *    to prepend a `-m coverage` command line argument.
 *
 * 3. This trait defines methods that will a) invoke the coverage task b) assume
 *    report data exists in the predefined location c) use that data to generate
 *    coverage reports.
