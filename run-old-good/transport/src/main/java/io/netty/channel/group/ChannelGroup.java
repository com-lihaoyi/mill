/**
 * A thread-safe {@link Set} that contains open {@link Channel}s and provides
 * various bulk operations on them.  Using {@link ChannelGroup}, you can
 * categorize {@link Channel}s into a meaningful group (e.g. on a per-service
 * or per-state basis.)  A closed {@link Channel} is automatically removed from
 * the collection, so that you don't need to worry about the life cycle of the
 * added {@link Channel}.  A {@link Channel} can belong to more than one
 * {@link ChannelGroup}.
 *
 * <h3>Broadcast a message to multiple {@link Channel}s</h3>
 * <p>
 * If you need to broadcast a message to more than one {@link Channel}, you can
 * add the {@link Channel}s associated with the recipients and call {@link ChannelGroup#write(Object)}:
 * <pre>
 * <strong>{@link ChannelGroup} recipients =
 *         new {@link DefaultChannelGroup}({@link GlobalEventExecutor}.INSTANCE);</strong>
 * recipients.add(channelA);
 * recipients.add(channelB);
 * ..
 * <strong>recipients.write({@link Unpooled}.copiedBuffer(
 *         "Service will shut down for maintenance in 5 minutes.",
 *         {@link CharsetUtil}.UTF_8));</strong>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Simplify shutdown process with {@link ChannelGroup}</h3>
 * <p>
 * If both {@link ServerChannel}s and non-{@link ServerChannel}s exist in the
 * same {@link ChannelGroup}, any requested I/O operations on the group are
 * performed for the {@link ServerChannel}s first and then for the others.
 * <p>
 * This rule is very useful when you shut down a server in one shot:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <strong>{@link ChannelGroup} allChannels =
 *         new {@link DefaultChannelGroup}({@link GlobalEventExecutor}.INSTANCE);</strong>
 *
 * public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
 *     {@link ServerBootstrap} b = new {@link ServerBootstrap}(..);
 *     ...
 *     b.childHandler(new MyHandler());
 *
 *     // Start the server
 *     b.getPipeline().addLast("handler", new MyHandler());
 *     {@link Channel} serverChannel = b.bind(..).sync();
 *     <strong>allChannels.add(serverChannel);</strong>
 *
 *     ... Wait until the shutdown signal reception ...
 *
 *     // Close the serverChannel and then all accepted connections.
 *     <strong>allChannels.close().awaitUninterruptibly();</strong>
 * }
 *
 * public class MyHandler extends {@link ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter} {
 *     {@code @Override}
 *     public void channelActive({@link ChannelHandlerContext} ctx) {
 *         // closed on shutdown.
 *         <strong>allChannels.add(ctx.channel());</strong>
 *         super.channelActive(ctx);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
