== Developer Documentation

The remainder of this readme is developer-documentation targeted at people who wish to work
on Mill's own codebase. The developer docs assume you have read through the user-facing
documentation linked above. It's also worth spending a few minutes reading the following
blog posts to get a sense of Mill's design & motivation:



Mill is built using Mill. To begin, you just need a JVM installed, and the
`./mill` script will be sufficient to bootstrap the project.

== IntelliJ Setup

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA to edit Mill's Scala code, IntelliJ's built in BSP support should
be sufficient to load the Mill project, but you need to set up the file association from
`*.mill` as Scala source files manually in the following settings:

* `Settings` / `Editor` / `File Types` / `Scala`, add the pattern `*.mill`

== Manual & Automated Testing

The following table contains the main ways you can test the code in
`com-lihaoyi/mill`, via manual testing or automated tests:

|===
| Config | Automated Testing | Manual Testing | Manual Testing CI
| In-Process Tests | `main.__.test`, `scalalib.test`, `contrib.buildinfo.test`, etc. |  |
| Sub-Process w/o packaging/publishing| `example.\\__.local.server`, `integration.__.local.server` | `dist.run` | `test-mill-dev.sh`
| Sub-Process w/ packaging/publishing | `example.\\__.packaged.server`, `integration.__.packaged.server` | `dist.assembly` | `test-mill-release.sh`
| Bootstrapping: Building Mill with your current checkout of Mill |  | `dist.installLocal` | `test-mill-bootstrap.sh`
|===

In general, `println` or `pprint.log` should work in most places and be sufficient for
instrumenting and debugging the Mill codebase. In the occasional spot where `println`
doesn't work you can use `mill.main.client.DebugLog.println` which writes to a file
`~/mill-debug-log.txt` in your home folder. `DebugLog` is useful for scenarios like
debugging Mill's terminal UI (where `println` would mess things up) or subprocesses
(where stdout/stderr may get captured or used and cannot be used to display your own
debug statements).

=== In-Process Tests

In-process tests live in the `.test` sub-modules of the various Mill modules.
These range from tiny unit tests, to larger integration tests that instantiate a
`mill.testkit.BaseModule` in-process and a `UnitTester` to evaluate tasks on it.

Most "core" tests live in `main.__test`; these should run almost instantly, and cover
most of Mill's functionality that is not specific to Scala/Scala.js/etc..
Tests specific to Scala/Scala.js/Scala-Native live in
`scalalib.test`/`scalajslib.test`/`scalanativelib.test` respectively, and take a lot longer
to run because running them involves actually compiling Scala code.

The various `contrib` modules also have tests in this style, e.g.
`contrib.buildinfo.test`

Note that the in-memory tests compile the `BaseModule` together with the test suite,
and do not exercise the Mill script-file bootstrapping, transformation, and compilation process.

=== Sub-Process Tests *without* Packaging/Publishing

`example.\\__.local.server` and `integration.__.local.server` tests run Mill end-to-end in a subprocess,
but *without* the expensive/slow steps of packaging the core packages into an assembly jar
and publishing the remaining packages to
`~/.ivy2/local`.
You can reproduce these tests manually using
`./mill dist.run <test-folder-path> <command>`.

`example` tests are written in a single `build.mill` file, with the test commands written
in a comment with a bash-like syntax together with the build code and comments that explain
the example.
These serve three purposes:

1. Basic smoke-tests to make sure the functionality works at all, without covering every
edge case

2. User-facing documentation, with the test cases, test commands, and explanatory comments
included in the Mill documentation site

3. Example repositories, that Mill users can download to bootstrap their own projects

The `integration` tests are similar to `example` tests and share most of their test
infrastructure, but with differences:

1. `integration` tests are meant to test features more thoroughly then
`example` tests, covering more and deeper edge cases even at the expense of readability

2. `integration` tests are written using a Scala test suite extending
`IntegrationTestSuite`, giving more flexibility at the expense of readability

You can reproduce any of the tests manually using `dist.run`, e.g.

**Automated Test**

[source,bash]
----
./mill "example.javalib.basic[1-simple].local.server"
----

**Manual Test**

[source,bash]
----
./mill dist.run example/javalib/basic/1-simple foo.run --text hello
----

**Manual Test using Launcher Script**

[source,bash]
----
./mill dist.launcher && (cd example/javalib/basic/1-simple && ../../../../out/dist/launcher.dest/run foo.run --text hello)
----

=== Sub-Process Tests *with* Packaging/Publishing

`example.\\__.server`, `integration.__.server`, `example.\\__.fork` and
`integration.__.fork` cover the same test cases as the `.local.server` tests described above, but
they perform packaging of the Mill core modules into an assembly jar, and publish the
remaining modules to `~/.ivy2/local`.
This results in a more realistic test environment, but at the cost of taking tens-of-seconds
more to run a test after making a code change.

You can reproduce these tests manually using `dist.installLocal`:

[source,bash]
----
./mill dist.installLocal && (cd example/basic/1-simple && ../../../mill-assembly.jar run --text hello)
----

You can also use `dist.native.installLocal` for a Graal Native Image executable,
which is slower to create but faster to start than the default executable assembly.

There are two six of these tests, `.{local,assembly,native}.{server,fork}`.

The first label specifies how the Mill code is packaged before testing

1. `.local` runs using all compiled Mill code directly in the `out/` folder. This is the fastest
and should be used for most testing

2. `.assembly` runs using the compiled Mill code either packaged into an assembly (for the Mill executable).
This is slower than `.local`, and normally isn't necessary unless you are debugging issues in the Mill
packaging logic.

3. `.native` runs using the compiled Mill code packaged into an assembly with a Graal native binary launcher.
This is the slowest mode is only really necessary for debugging Mill's Graal native binary configuration.

The second label specifies how the Mill process is managed during the test:


1. `.server` test run the test cases with the default configuration, so consecutive commands
run in the same long-lived background server process

2. `.fork` test run the test cases with `--no-server`, meaning each command runs in a newly
spawned Mill process

In general you should spend most of your time working with the `.local.server` version of the
`example` and `integration` tests to save time, and only run the others if you have a specific
thing you want to test that needs those code paths to run.

=== Bootstrapping: Building Mill with your current checkout of Mill

To test bootstrapping of Mill's own Mill build using a version of Mill built from your checkout, you can run

[source,bash]
----
./mill dist.installLocal
ci/patch-mill-bootstrap.sh
----

This creates a standalone assembly at `target/mill-release` you can use, which references jars
published locally in your `~/.ivy2/local` cache, and applies any necessary patches to
`build.mill` to deal with changes in Mill between the version specified in `.config/mill-version`
that is normally used to build Mill and the `HEAD` version your assembly was created from.
You can then use this standalone assembly to build & re-build your current Mill checkout without
worrying about stomping over compiled code that the assembly is using.

You can also use `./mill dist.installLocalCache` to provide a "stable" version of Mill that
can be used locally in bootstrap scripts.

This assembly is design to work on bash, bash-like shells and Windows Cmd.
If you have another default shell like zsh or fish, you probably need to invoke it with
`sh ~/mill-release` or prepend the file with a proper shebang.

If you want to install into a different location or a different Ivy repository, you can set its optional parameters.

.Install into `/tmp`
[source,bash]
----
$ ./mill dist.installLocal --binFile /tmp/mill --ivyRepo /tmp/millRepo
...
Published 44 modules and installed /tmp/mill
----
=== Testing Documentation Changes

For testing documentation changes locally, you can generate documentation for the current checkout via

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mill docs.fastPages
----

To generate documentation for both the current checkout and earlier versions, you can use


[source,bash]
----
$ ./mill docs.localPages
----

=== Troubleshooting

In case of troubles with caching and/or incremental compilation, you can always restart from scratch removing the `out` directory:

[source,bash]
----
rm -rf out/
----

=== Autofix and Autoformatting

To run all autofixes and autoformatters:

```bash
./mill __.fix + mill.javalib.palantirformat.PalantirFormatModule/ + mill.scalalib.scalafmt.ScalafmtModule/ + mill.kotlinlib.ktlint.KtlintModule/
./mill --meta-level 1 mill.scalalib.scalafmt.ScalafmtModule/
```

These are run automatically on pull requests, so feel free to `pull` down the changes if you want
to continue developing after your PR has been autofixed for you.

== Continuous Integration & Testing

* Mill's pull-request validation runs with
https://mill-build.org/mill/large/selective-execution.html[Selective Test Execution]
enabled; this automatically selects the tests to run based on the code or build configuration
that changed in that PR. To disable this, you can label your PR with `run-all-tests`, which
will run all tests on a PR regardless of what code was changed

* Mill tests draft PRs _on contributor forks_ of the repository, so please make sure Github
Actions are enabled on your fork. Once you are happy with your draft, mark it `ready_for_review`
and it will run CI on Mill's repository before merging

* If you need to debug things in CI, you can comment/uncomment the two sections of
`.github/workflows/run-tests.yml` in order to skip the main CI jobs and only run the command(s)
you need, on the OS you want to test on. This can greatly speed up the debugging process
compared to running the full suite every time you make a change.

== Project Layout

The Mill project is organized roughly as follows:

=== Core modules that are included in the main assembly

* `runner`, `main.*`, `scalalib`, `scalajslib`, `scalanativelib`.

These are general lightweight and dependency-free: mostly configuration & wiring of a Mill
build and without the heavy lifting.

Heavy lifting is delegated to the worker modules (described below), which the core modules
resolve from Maven Central (or from the local filesystem in dev) and load into isolated
classloaders.

=== Worker modules that are resolved from Maven Central

* `scalalib.worker`, `scalajslib.worker[0.6]`, `scalajslib.worker[1.0]`

These modules are where the heavy-lifting happens, and include heavy dependencies like the
Scala compiler, Scala.js optimizer, etc.. Rather than being bundled in the main assembly &
classpath, these are resolved separately from Maven Central (or from the local filesystem
in dev) and kept in isolated classloaders.

This allows a single Mill build to use multiple versions of e.g. the Scala.js optimizer
without classpath conflicts.

=== Contrib modules

* `contrib/bloop/`, `contrib/flyway/`, `contrib/scoverage/`, etc.

These are modules that help integrate Mill with the wide variety of different tools and
utilities available in the JVM ecosystem.

These modules are not as stringently reviewed as the main Mill core/worker codebase, and
are primarily maintained by their individual contributors.
These are maintained as part of the primary Mill Github repo for easy testing/updating as
the core Mill APIs evolve, ensuring that they are always tested and passing against the
corresponding version of Mill.

== Compatibility & Stability

Mill maintains backward binary compatibility for each major version (`major.minor.point`),
enforced with Mima, for the following packages:

- `mill.api`
- `mill.util`
- `mill.define`
- `mill.eval`
- `mill.resolve`
- `mill.scalalib`
- `mill.scalajslib`
- `mill.scalanativelib`

Other packages like `mill.runner`, `mill.bsp`, etc. are on the classpath but offer no
compatibility guarantees.

Currently, Mill does not offer compatibility guarantees for `mill.contrib`
packages, although they tend to evolve slowly.
This may change over time as these packages mature over time.

== Project Maintenance

=== Pull Requests

* Changes to the main branch need a pull request.
Exceptions are preparation commits for releases, which are meant to be pushed with tags in one go
* Merged pull request (and closed issues) need to be assigned to a Milestone
* Pull requests are typically merged via "Squash and merge", so we get a linear and useful history
* Larger pull request, where it makes sense to keep single commits, or with multiple authors may be committed via merge commits.

=== Commit Messages

* The title should be meaningful and may contain the pull request number in parentheses (typically automatically generated on GitHub)
* The description should contain additional required details, which typically reflect the content of the first PR comment
* A full link to the pull request should be added via a line: `Pull request: <link>`
* If the PR has multiple authors but is merged as merge commit, those authors should be included via a line for each co-author: `Co-authored-by: <author>`
* If the message contains links to other issues or pull requests, you should use full URLs to reference them
